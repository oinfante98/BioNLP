a mutation in aral and a known mutation in arac lead to the loss of arai2 binding , while bind to aral -lsb- be unaffected . both mutant fail to activate the promoter of the arabad operon . we propose that aral2 occupancy by arac protein lead to rna polymerase recognition of the arabad promoter and that arall act as a switch mechanism allow both the repressor and the activator form of arac protein to regulate the arabad promoter . transcription initiation at the promoter of the escherichia coli arabad operon be regulate both positively and negatively by the arac protein . the site of arac interaction require for activation -lrb- arai -rrb- be located very close to the rna polymerase bind site -lrb- 2 - 4 -rrb- , whereas the site for repression -lrb- arao2 -rrb- be located at a considerable distance from the start point of arabad transcription -lrb- 5 - 8 -rrb- . recently , there have be considerable effort direct toward understand how the arabad promoter be down - regulate by a farupstream site -lrb- 7 , 9 , 10 -rrb- , whereas the mechanism of arabad activation upon the addition of inducer remain largely unexplored . it be well know that strain delete of the arao2 site still require l - arabinose to initiate transcription of arabad , a fact that indicate that the relief of repression be not responsible for promoter activation . in cell contain arao2 , the relief of repression accompany activation but be not the cause of it . promoter activation must require some ligand - induce event at araL . the state of aral occupancy by arac protein be a important issue in understand the mechanism of promoter activation , yet , with one exception -lrb- ref . 10 ; however , see discussion -rrb- , there have be no experiment report that search for a qualitative change in the interaction of arac protein with araf upon induction . in this paper , we present datum show that , in the absence of the ligand l - arabinose , arac protein bind to two turn on the dna . the addition of arabinose lead to bind to a additional downstream sequence , represent two more turn on the dna . we propose that the shift in the binding at araI from a two - turn occupancy to a four - turn occupancy correspond to the transition from a inactive to a active promoter . thus , the arai site be divisible into two region , which we designate araif and arai2 . in the absence of arabinose , arac protein can bind only ara ! , , but the addition of inducer allow arac protein to bind both araif and aral2 . the publication cost of this article be defray in part by page charge payment . this article must therefore be hereby marked '' advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U . s . c . § 1734 solely to indicate this fact . 8814 p - bad rnapoi Aral CAP AraO Ara arabad mrna I ~ ~ arac mrna * 0 0 * * s + 1 - 50 - 100 - 150 - 200 - 250 FIG . 1 . the controlling region of the arabad operon . the overlap and divergent promoter of arabad -lrb- pbad -rrb- and arac -lrb- pc -rrb- be show with the position of the contact site of rna polymerase -lrb- rna pol -rrb- , arac protein -lrb- arai , arao , , and arao2 -rrb- , and the camp binding protein -lrb- cap -rrb- . the pc rna polymerase bind site -lrb- open box -rrb- overlap AraO , -lrb- stippled box -rrb- . the start point and direction of transcription be indicate by arrow . the number mark position of nucleotide relative to the start point of arabad transcription . further evidence for two discrete state of aral occupancy be obtain from two mutant , one a promoter mutant and the other a arac gene mutant . these mutant be defective in only arai2 binding , and both fail to activate the arabad promoter . material and method isolation of arac protein . arac protein be isolate from a hyperproduce strain harbor a plasmid that carry a wild - type arac allele fuse to the tac promoter . detail of the construction of the overproduce plasmid will be present elsewhere -lrb- c . f . , unpublished datum -rrb- . for the isolation of arac protein , cell be cultivate in 8 liter of minimal glycerol ampicillin medium contain per liter 7.0 g of k2hpo4 , 3.0 g of kh2po4 , 1 g of -lrb- nh4 -rrb- 2so4 , 0.1 g of mgso4 - 7h2o , 4 mg of thiamine , 2.0 ml of glycerol , and 50 mg of sodium ampicillin and be induce with 100 AM isopropyl 8 - d - thiogalactoside . purification step be as describe . the final product have a a280 - to - a260 ratio of 1.9 and appear homogeneous by electrophoretic analysis in nadodso4 / polyacrylamide gel . fig . 2 illustrate sample take at successive step during the isolation of arac protein .

Walker and DeMoss have recently show that change the left side of the fnr box from ttgat to ttgqt result in a drastic reduction of fnr - dependent expression of the narghji opeion . follow introduction of this modification into the fnrl box of pmv45 , the result plasmid be transform into mv1190 and the cell plate on MacConkey - lactose medium supplement with nitrate and ampicillin . plasmid be isolate from both red and white colony and the nark regulatory region sequence . as expect , the plasmid carry by fhe white colony contain the modify fnrl box while those from the red colony be the unmodified wild type . the modify piasmid , pvb5 , express drastically reduce level of p - galactosidase under all condition , although some anaerobic induction and stimulation by nitrate under anaerobic condition be observe . these result demonstrate that anaerobic induction of nark gene transcription be dependent on a functional fnrl box . when the fnr2 box of pmv45 be similarly modify . regulation of nark gene expression in escherichia coli 3599 cell of mv1190 carry the mutant piasmid be isolate as ' fish - eye ' colony on fhe nitrate - supplement , MacConkey - lactose plate . in this case , the modify piasmid , pvb6 , express essentially the same level of p - galactosidase in strain rk66p as fhe wild - type piasmid , pmv45 , under anaerobic condition but the stimulation by nitrate be reduce about three - fold . when both fnr box be modify , the result piasmid , pvb7 , express level of | 3 - galactosidase very similar to those observe with p \ / b5 where only the fnrl box be modify . assume that the fnr2 box would be affect similarly to the fnrl box by the modification , these result establish that a functional fnr2 box be not require for the anaerobic induction of transcription of nark but it do appear to be require for the maximum stimulation of transcription of the gene by nitrate . discussion the major nark transcript , identify in the primer extension experiment , accumulate at very low level under aerobic condition and be induce to maximum level under anaerobic condition in the presence of nitrate . this be in agreement with the demonstration by Stewart and Parales that narkgene expression be dependent on the / ran - act factor fnr and narl , which be activate by anaerobiosis and nitrate , respectively . the start site for the major transcript coincide exactly with the one predict by alignment of the fnrl box identify in fhe nark promoter region with the fnr box and transcription start site identify in the narghji promoter sequence . putative - 10 and - 35 sequence can be identify for fhe nark transcription start site which would constitute a relatively poor o ™ - dependent promoter . the putative - 10 region . laaggt -lrb- compare to the consensus tataat -rrb- . and the putative - 35 region , ttgcct -lrb- compare to the consensus ttgaca -rrb- . be separate by 14 nucleotide , compare to the optimum 17 - nucleotlde separation for the consensus promoter sequence -lrb- aoyoma etai , 1983 -rrb- . when the nark regulatory region be analyse with the MACTARGSEARCH Program -lrb- Mulligan et be , 1984 -rrb- and the consensus sequence for e . coli promoter pi receive a score of 40.2 % . accord to Mulligan et be , most of the promoter which have a poor homology score -lrb- < 45 % -rrb- be know to require activator -lrb- s -rrb- for maximal expression . as in the case of the narghjt promoter , a consensus fnr box -lrb- fnrl -rrb- centre at - 41.5 bp from the transcription start site be critical for synthesis of the major nark transcript , which occur primarily under anaerobic condition when Fnr be activate and presumably bind to fhe fnr box . the promoter for one of the minor transcnpt identify in the primer extension experiment , p2 , appear to be more similar to the o ™ - dependent promofer consensus . effect of mutation in the fnrl and fnr2 box . | j - galactosidase -lrb- Miller unit -rrb- Fnr Box sequence '' aerobic anaerobic piasmid '' 2 1 aerobic - i - nitrate anaerobic + nitrate pmv45 atgat ttgat pvb5 atgat ttggt pvb6 atggt ttgat pvb7 atggt ttggt a . grow and express in strain rk66p . b . leave side of each fnr box as show in fig . 1 . 120 1770 3 38 114 460 2 38 sequence than the pi promoter ;

DeMoss of the nark gene and the narghji operon , Noji et al . propose that a homologous sequence , tactc - ctta , share by the two upstream region -lcb- fig . 1 -rrb- define a narl - bind site . this sequence be present in a 29 bp fragment which have be show by Li and DeMoss to contain a c / s - act factor require for narl - mediate nitrate stimulation of narghji transcription and Dong etai have recently show by saturation mutagenesis of this region that specificity for the narghji operon response reside in the six - base sequence tactcc . while there be very little homology between the nark and narghji regulatory region other than this sequence and the fnrl box sequence , a closely related sequence , tactcacta -lrb- narli in fig . 1 -rrb- , be located in the intervene region of the narkgene . the elimination of the nitrate response by the deletion of the narl2 box from the regulatory region of nark -lrb- piasmid pmv51 -rrb- demonstrate that the narl2 box be require for narl - mediated stimulation and that the narli box alone can not promote the stimulation of transcription by nitrate . however , the result do not rule out the possibility that the narli box be functional but only in the presence of the narl2 box where it might act as a secondary and perhaps co - operative narl - bind site . the centre of the two narl box , space 96 bp -lrb- or approximately nine integral helical turn -rrb- apart , would present bind site on the same face of the dna and could permit interaction between the bind narl subunit . while it be dear , as discuss above , that the assume inactivation of the fnr2 box by site - direct modification do not affect the anaerobic induction of nark transcription , it do significantly reduce the level of stimulation by nitrate under anaerobic condition . it be possible that fnr binding to the fnr2 box augment the binding to the fnr1 box and permit the higher level of anaerobic expression which occur in the presence of nitrate . the two sequence be centre at position separate by 38 bp -lrb- or 3.6 turn of dna -rrb- which place the bind fnr on opposite face of the dna and make a direct interaction difficult to envisage . a alternative possibility be that Fnr , by analogy with cap -lrb- camp activator protein -rrb- with which it share considerable sequence homology -lrb- Shaw et be , 1983 -rrb- , act as a dna bend profein when bind to the fnr2 box and facilitate loop formation which may be involve in narl - mediated stimulation of transcripfion . in this report , we establish fhat the narkgene and the narghji operon share the same regulation pattern : induction by anaerobiosis and stimulation by nitrate . but at the molecular level , it appear that the regulation and expression of nark gene be more complex than for the narghj / operon in fhat narkgene have more than one promoter , two potential fnr - bind site which have distinguishable regulatory effect , and at least one functional narl - bind site . the nark and narghji promoter region share homologous fnr and narl box sequence separate by approximately 150 bp of non - homologous sequence which in both case include specific region require for full , functional interaction of the two / ran - act factor with the transcriptional complex . the construction and study of hybrid promoter should provide significant insight into the regulation of these gene at the molecular level and understanding of the mechanism underlie the activation of transcription initiation by narl and fnr at the nark and narghji promoter . experimental procedure strain and growth condition e . coii strain mv1190 -lcb- a -lcb- lac - pro -rrb- , thi , supe , a -lrb- sr / - reca -rrb- 306 : : tn10 / f . trad236 , proab . / ac / ^ zam15 -rrb- and cj236 -lrb- duti , ungi . thil , relav , pcj105 -lrb- cm '' -rrb- be provide with the site - directed mutagenesis kit of BioRad Laboratories . strain rk66p and rk53p be pen derivative construct , respectively , from strain rk5266 -lrb- nark : : tn ?

Mauzy and m . a . Hermodson the ribosome binding site within the rbsk gene also suggest that the rbsr gene be located on the same transcript as rbsk . because rbsr do not bind to the region of dna span the 3 ' end of rbsk and the first 260 bp of rbsr or to a potential secondary promoter region between rbsb and rbsk , regulate expression of rbsr from those region appear unlikely , although constitutive expression from a secondary promoter upstream of rbsr have not be exclude . another interesting feature of rbsr expression be the presence of a ttg start codon in the coding sequence , which be verify use the protein sequence from a rbsr - @ - galactosidase fusion protein and from affinity - purify rbsr . of all know start codon in the genebank sequence , the TTG have a frequency of less than 2 % . the unusual start codon for rbsr also suggest down - regulation of rbsr expression due to lower translational efficiency , as evidence indicate that there be a strong preference for the atg start codon in the bacterial translational machinery -lrb- munson et al . , 1984 ; Schulz & Reznikoff , 1990 -rrb- . although a small amount of rbsr be purify by affinity chromatography late in this study , we have have some difficulty produce significant amount of the protein . the several site at which down - regulation of expression may occur may be partly responsible for the low expression from the various plasmid . toxicity of high level of the repressor may also be a problem . because we only have crude extract available during most of this investigation , the dna - binding study be perform with they . the result , together with the control experiment run simultaneously , indicate that rbsr do bind rbs0 , and of the sugar test , only ribose be effective in disrupt that complex . no ancillary factor be need to form the rbsr - rbso complex when pure rbsr be test . at least under the condition use , no other potential rbsr binding site in the rb operon be find , although the use of crude extract may have interfere with weak binding at other site . we believe that to be less than likely on physiological grounds . if ribokinase be noncoordinately express relative to the rb transport gene as early datum suggest -lrb- David & Weismeyer , 1970 -rrb- , then a constitutive promoter within the operon be the most likely explanation . we have attempt to find evidence for transcription from such a promoter without success -lrb- Hope , 1986 -rrb- . analysis employ crude extract prevent the determination of binding constant for the rbsr - rbso complex and for the rbsr - sugar interaction . however , the footprinting assay should not be affect , since enormous excess of competitor dna be use in such assay . by homology to laci -lrb- Mauzy & Hermodson , 1992 -rrb- the first 60 residue of rbsr form the dna - binding domain . the highest degree of similarity between the member of this family of repressor be find in this domain , and the most similar region of all span the first 22 residue of rbsr . these residue form the first helix - turn - helix and contact the dna -lrb- kaptein et al . , 1985 ;
