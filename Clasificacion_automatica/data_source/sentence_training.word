AATAGTGCTT TTATGAGGAA AATAGGCATC TTATGCCTAG Results and Discussion NarL piays a role at the nirB promoter : effects of a onebase - pair deletion The starting point of this work was a short DNA fragment . fuNy described by Beli et al . , carrying the nirB promoter region from base pairs - 150 to - H36 with respect to the transcription start , with an EcoRl linker cloned upstream of the transcnption start and a H / ndlll linker downstream . This fragment , illustrated in Fig . 1 , contains all the sequence information required for regulation . To monitor pnirB expression , the fragment was cloned into the low copy number , broad - host - range lac expression vector , pRW50 -LCB- Lodge et ai , 1992 -RRB- . In the resulting recombinant plasmid , pKTI , | 3 - galactosidase expression is controlled by pnirB : expression is induced during anaerobic growth conditions with optimal induction dependent on the presence of nitrite or nitrate . In previous work . Bell etai showed that the induction of pnirB by anaerobiosis and nitrite was unaffected by deletion of sequences upstream of position -- 83 -LRB- DR83 in Fig . 1 -RRB- . However deletions to base pairs - 68 and - 55 -LRB- DR68 and DR55 -RRB- led to loss of induction by nitrite -LRB- and nitrate -RRB- , although they did not abolish anaerobic induction since they fall outside the FNR - binding site . The simplest explanation for this is that the DR68 and DR55 deletions destroy the binding site for some frans - acting factor necessary for nitrite / nitrate induction . To investigate this , we made a derivative of pnirB carrying a one - base - pair deletion at - 57 between the supposed nitrite / nitrate response element and the FNR - binding site -LRB- we had previously checked that a point mutation at - 57 had no effect on pnirB activity -RRB- . The DNA fragment carrying this new promoter . pnirBA57 , was cloned into the Alac expression plasmid , pRW50 , the resulting plasmid was transformed into the Alac host strain JCB387 and p - galactosidase expression was monitored during growth in a variety of conditions . Data in Fig . 2 confirm that expression from '' wild - type ' pnirB is induced by anaerobiosis and further stimulated by nitrite or nitrate . However , with pnirBA57 , although induction occurred in anaerobic conditions , no 2.500 2,000 - 1,500 - 1,000 - Fig . 2 .

The bars illustrate p - galactosidase levels made in JCB387 -LRB- NarL * -RRB- or JCB3883 -LRB- NarL '' -RRB- cells carrying pKTI wifh lacZ expression controlled by pnirB or a derivative , pnirBA57 , with a one - basepair deletion at - 57 , Ceils were grown in different conditions as indicated in the inset to the figure . The Escherichia coli nirB promoter 153 further nitrite - dependent induction was apparent and nitrate caused a sharp decrease in expression . In a recent study . Page et ai showed that disruption of narL led to decreased expression from pnirB . To recheck the possible involvement of NarL factor , expression from pnirB and pnirBA57 was measured in strain JCB3883 . which is a narL derivative of JCB387 , Data in Fig . 2 confirm that the effect of the narL mutation is to decrease expression from pnirB in all conditions . With pnirBA57 , the sharp repression of activity by nitrate is relieved by disruption of narL . As a control for these experiments we also measured the effects of disrupting narL on expression from a semisynthetic FNR - dependent promoter in which the nirB FNR - binding site was ' transplanted ' into the E . coli meIR promoter . Expression from this promoter -LRB- F2pmelR D25X , described in Fig . 5 of Bell et ai , 1990 -RRB- is induced anaerobically but is not stimulated further by nitrite or nitrate and is unaffected by narL mutations -LRB- not shown -RRB- . Thus , the simplest explanation for the results in Fig . 2 is that NarL protein binds to a site upstream of - 57 and is , at least partially , responsible for nitrite and nitrate effects . Misplacing the NarL - binding site by one base pair stops induction and leads to NarL - dependent repression , presumably as the misplaced NarL interferes with FNR . Mutagenesis of a putative NarL - binding site Scrutiny of the pnirB sequence from - 83 to - 57 revealed an imperfect inverted repeat from position - 79 to - 60 which could be a site for a DNA - binding regulatory protein -LRB- Fig , 1 -RRB- , The two 10 bp motifs that make up this inverted repeat show similarities to elements in a 27 bp sequence located around - 200 at the narG promoter , that Li and DeMoss showed to be the NarL - binding site . Figure 1 shows that the narG sequence from - 207 to - 188 appears to be made up of a direct repeat of two similar 10 - base elements , whilst the nirB promoter from - 79 to - 60 carries an inverted repeat of related sequences . To investigate the significance of the nirB inverted repeat we made a number of base - pair changes using site - directed mutagenesis . In a first experiment we made a CG to G : C transversion at - 75 -LRB- p75G -RRB- , a G : C to C : G tranversion at - 64 -LCB- p64C -RRB- and the double mutation combining both changes -LRB- p64C p75G -RRB- . The changes are Illustrated in Fig . 1 : note that the two mutations are identical in the context of the inverted repeat , both being located at the fifth position of the 10 - base element . The results in show that the two single mutations produce similar effects : they both cause a decrease in anaerobic levels of expression from pnirB , they abolish nitrite induction but have little effect on induction by nitrate . The effects of the single mutations are similar to the effects of disrupting narL However , combined together , the p75G and p64C mutations lead to a more severe decrease in pn / rSactivity in all conditions and prevent induction by both nitrite and nitrate . We next created transversions at the sixth position of the 10 - base element by making the mutations p74G -LRB- C : G to G : C at - 74 -RRB- and p65C -LRB- A : T to C : G at - 65 -RRB- , The results in show that the effect of these single changes is to decrease anaerobic induction both with and without nitrite , but , again , induction by nitrate is not suppressed . However , when combined , the p74G and p65C mutations suppress pnirB expression in alt conditions . The simplest interpretation of these results is that the nirB inverted repeat is recognized by two NarL subunits . and that NarL binding is needed for optimal pnirB expression both during growth in anaerobic conditions and during nitrite / nitrate induction . It is not clear why the p74G mutation has more severe effects than the p65C change . Interestingly , in the context of the nirB inverted repeat , the base at position 6 of the 10 - base element is not symmetric . We found that the transitions p65G and p74T had no effect on pnirB activity , suggesting that the binding factor can tolerate a pyrimidine but not a purine at position 6 of the 10 - base element . Effects of NarL - binding - site mutations in a narL background Although NarL was originally characterized as a factor essential for nitrate - induction of gene expression , disruption of narL does not completely stop nitrate induction of pnirB -LRB- Page et ai . 1990 , and Fig , 2 -RRB- , It is possible that cells contain a second transcription factor responding to nitrate , though , unlike NarL . this putative factor must be unable to respond to nitrite . We therefore investigated the effects of mutations at the fifth and sixth positions of the inverted repeat elements on pnirB expression in the absence of NarL , The results in show that three of the four single mutations decrease NarL - independent stimulation of pnirB expression by nitrate . We conclude that any second factor is likely to bind to sequences similar to NarL , Note that the single and double mutations also reduce the FNR - dependent pnirB expression during anaerobic growth in the absence of externally added nitrite or nitrate , suggesting that both NarL and the second factor are needed for optimal anaerobically induced FNR - dependent transcription . A mutation in FNR that affects induction o / pnirB Since expression from pnirB is dependent on FNR in all growth conditions , it is possible that additional proteins , responsible for nitrite and nitrate induction , exert their effect by interacting with FNR . We therefore investigated the effects of known FNR mutations on nitrite and ' nitrate induction at pnirB . 154 K . L Tyson , A . I . Bell , J . A . Cole , andS . J . W .

Cells were grown in different conditions as shown in Ihe inset to the figure . The positive control mutation G85A -LRB- a giyoine to alanine change at position 85 -RRB- probably alters the ' patch ' on FNR that interacts with RNA polymerase and causes a sixfold reduction in anaerobically induced expression from the semi - synthetic FNR - dependent promoter F2pmelR D25X -LRB- Williams et ai , 1991 -RRB- . The results in Fig , 3 show that the G85A mutation in FNR has a smaller effect at pnirB , decreasing anaerobic expression twofold . However , further nitrite - or nitrate - dependent induction is almost totally suppressed , suggesting that NarL - dependent activation by nitrite or nitrate is mediated by FNR . The FNR * mutation D154A increases aerobic expression from the narGHJI promoter , probably by ' freezing ' FNR in an active conformation -LRB- Kiley and Reznikoff , 1991 -RRB- . Data in Fig . 3 show that the D154A mutation results in a twofold increase in aerobic expression from pn / / e whilst not altering induction by anaerobiosis , nitrite and nitrate . NarL binding sites at different promoters The similarities between the 10 - base sequence elements at both pnarG and pnirB , and the effects of pnirB point mutations , prompt us to propose that these elements contain the primary target for NarL monomers . Support for this comes from Dong et ai who showed that changes at positions 3 , 5 , 7 and 8 of narG box 1 reduce induction of the narG promoter by nitrate . Interestingly , Berg et ai reported the sequence of another NarL - induced operon , fdnGHI , encoding the formate dehydrogenase complex that passes electrons to the narGHJ / nitrate reductase , Li and Stewart identified an inverted repeat in this sequence as the likely NarLbinding site , centred around position - 114 ; ^ upstream of the transcription start . The first six lines of Fig . 4 show that the 10 - base sequences upstream and downstream of this position are strikingly similar to the 10 - base sequences at pnarG and pnirB , suggesting that two NarL subunits might bind to an inverted repeat at the nirB and fdnGHI promoters , whilst , at pnarG , NarL binds to a direct repeat . This prompted us to search for similar sequences at other NarL - sensitive promoters in E . coli At the frdA promoter -LRB- Cole , 1982 -RRB- . where NarL acts as a repressor , we located two similar 10 - base sequences from - 9 to + ^ and from - nil to + 2 . Similarly at the dmsA promoter -LCB- Bilous etai , 1988 -RRB- , which is also repressed by NarL . we located three elements , which are listed in Fig . 4 , At the narK promoter , the sequence around - 200 contains elements similar to the pnarG NarL - binding sequence -LRB- Noji etai , 1989 ; Dong etai , 1992 -RRB- , which are also listed . The alignment of 13 sites shows perfect conservation of C at position 5 and the presence of a pyrimidine at position 6 , in accord with the mutational analyses of . From the alignment , we suggest a minimal consensus 5 ' - * * TACY * KT * - 3 ' -LRB- Y - pyrlmidine ; K = A or C -RRB- , which was deduced using a rule that disallowed any more than one difference across the 13 sequences .

The striking feature of the sequence collation in Fig . 4 is that the position and organization of potential NarL - binding sites differs from one promoter to another . Presumably this reflects differences in the role of NarL at different regulatory regions . We do not understand why in some cases NarL binds to an inverted repeat whilst in others the target is a direct repeat , but this raises intriguing questions about NarL binding stoichiometries and co - operativity between subunits . One possibility is that the protein is monomeric and there are no interactions between bound subunits . Alternatively , the region between the DNA - binding domain and the aggregation ' patch ' might be flexible , allowing interactions between monomers bound in different configurations . Note that there is a precedent for this sort of flexibility with proteins of the AraC family -LRB- Ramos et ai , 1990 -RRB- and E . coii TyrR -LRB- Pittard and Davidson , 1991 -RRB- . Two - step activation of transcription at pnirB . some conciusicns Sequence analysis of NarL shows that it is the ' regulator ' half of a two - component system that , by analogy with other members of this class , should bind to target DNA via a helix - turn - helix motif near the C - terminus -LRB- reviewed by Gross et ai , 1989 -RRB- . Taken together , our results suggest that NarL protein binds to an inverted repeat from positions - 79 to - 60 at pnirB . Unfortunately , we can not prove this point since , to our knowledge , no one , as yet , has reported NarL binding to DNA targets in vitro and our efforts to date have been abortive . At pnirB , NarL appears to be essential for nitrite induction of expression , since mutation of narL or alteration of the putative binding site suppresses nitrite effects . In contrast , we found clear nitrate - dependent induction in a narL background , suggesting that there might be a second factor responding to nitrate . This observation complicates the interpretation of our data and , although likely , we have no proof that NarL is directly responsible for nitrate induction of pnirB . Surprisingly , suppression of nitrate induction requires two symmetry - related mutations in the NarL - binding site , whilst nitrite induction is suppressed by one mutation . We can not be sure whether this is due to the second nitrate stimulatory factor or whether the binding properties of NarL differ according to whether it is triggered by nitrate or nitrite . The effects of changes in the NarL - binding site on anaerobic induction from pnirB in the absence of nitrite or nitrate were surprising . We had assumed that an intact FNR - binding site would be sufficient for this induction and yet removal of NarL , either by disrupting the gene or altering the target , leads to clear decreases in anaerobic expression . This result shows that NarL is ' active ' in the absence of extracellular nitrate or nitrite and suggests that FNR needs a ' helper ' when in the context of the nirB promoter . NarL appears to play different roles at the nirB and narG promoters . At the narG promoter , NarL binds far upstream of the transcription start and requires integration host factor , which probably bends the intervening DNA and helps NarL ' reach ' downstream : there is some evidence that NarL can directly contact RNA polymerase , since NarL - dependent activation can be detected in an fnr mutant -LRB- Walker and DeMoss , 1991 ; Rabin ef ai , 1992 -RRB- . In contrast , at the nirB promoter , NarL binds adjacent to FNR . FNR - independent expression is minimal , and the simplest explanation for the results is that NarL interacts with FNR : we suppose that the G85A change in FNR alters the conformation ol FNR to interfere with this interaction . Current models of how FNR activates transcription -LRB- based mainly on in vitro studies with the cyclic AMP receptor protein , GRP , a related activator -RRB- envisage that the DNA wraps around the FNR , resulting in a contact between RNA polymerase and sequences upstream of bound FNR -LRB- Busby , 1992 -RRB- . It is possible that NarL , which also binds to this upstream region , is necessary to help ' set up ' this interaction . At semi - synthetic FNR - dependent promoters -LRB- such as F2pmelR D25X . see Bell et al . , 1990 -RRB- an FNR - site alone is sufficient for efficient FNR - dependent transcription activation . However , at pnirB , the promoter context appears to impose the necessity of an upstream factor for efficient FNR activity . There is a156 K . L Tyson , A . I . Bell , J . A . Cole , and S . J . W .

I -RRB- NA fl ' om the plasmid was subcloned to isolate a small fragntent containing an active araFGH promoter Plasmid BEKI80 DNA was cleaved with restriction enzymes HaeIII , FnudlI or Alul in separate reactions and HindIII linkers were added . The fl ' agments were ligated to the promoter vector pK01 , which places the galactokinase gene under control of the cloned promoter -LRB- McKenney et al . , 1982 -RRB- . The DNA was transformed into a GalK - strain and isolates were obtained that were Gal + only in tile presence of arabinose . A 1 '' 1 kb HiudIII fragment containing an arabinose dependent promoter was found in several candidates . Tile plasmid was cleaved with EcoRI nuelease to remove a 600 bp fragment upstream from the promoter producing tile plasmid pWH54 , which contains a 500 bp HindIII - EcoFCI fragment with the araFGH promoter . Sequence analysis showed that the HindIH linker had been added at an AluI site . The Sequence of the araFGH operon has been determined by Scripture et al . . With few exceptions -LRB- see Discussion -RRB- our sequence matches the region from 12 to 518 bp upstream from the araF gene , confirming that pWH54 does contain the araFGH promoter . -LRB- c -RRB- Transcriptional start site of PFGx The start site of transcription in vivo was mapped by isolating cellular RNA and performing $ 1 assays using as a probe the 500 bp promoter fragments 5 ' labeled at the HindIII site .

Cellular RNA from strain pWH54 / SH313 was hybridized to the 500 bp PFGH probe 5 ' end - labeled at the HindIII site and subjected to S 1 nuclease analysis . Lanes A to D , DNA - RNA hybrids were digested with 5 units S 1 at 37 ° C . Cells were grown in M9 salts glycerol medium . and L - arabinose was added before harvesting for time : lane A , 0 min ; lane B , 7 min ; lane C , 30 min ; and lane D , 5 generations . Lanes E to G , cells were grown in the presence of arabinose for 5 generations and DNA - RNA hybrids incubated with : lane E , 40 units S 1 , 37 ° C ; lane F , 5 units S l , 45 ° C ; lane G , 5 units S t 32 ° C . Sequencing size markers , G + A and AC reactions , are shown at right ; the sequence of the top strand is indicated . of araFGH , since the HindIII end was added as a linker and will not hybridize . Therefore , the kinetics of induction of the operon were studied by growing cells containing the plasmid pWH54 in the presence or in the absence of arabinose . In the absence of arabinose , no signal was observed . After an induction period of seven minutes very little transcript was produced , while after 30 minutes approximately one - half the maximal level of transcription was seen . When cells were grown for five generations -LRB- 600 rain -RRB- in arabinose , the maximum signal was obtained at one region that we have assigned + 1 . The signal contains a cluster of three adjacent bands , so the central band is proposed as the start site with an errror of ± l bp . No other apparent sites were observed when the digestion temperature was raised to 45 ° C or lowered to 32 ° C or when the level of S 1 nuclease was varied from 5 to 40 units per reaction . These data place the start of transcription l ll bases upstream from the first codon of the araF gene . -LRB- d -RRB- Transcription of araFGH in vitro To determine the requirements for transcription of this operon , we perform in vitro transcription experiments using purified AraC , CRP and RNA polymerase . The plasmid was linearized by cutting at the SmaI site at + 120 , and reactions were carried out on whole plasmid DNA . Only one runoff transcript was found to be dependent upon both AraC and CRP . In the absence of AraC protein a low level of a 125 base transcript was seen -LCB- Fig . 4 -RRB- . In the presence of saturating amounts of both activators , the same transcription product was increased fivefold . In the absence of CRP no 125 base product is made even in the presence of maximal AraC protein . The observed transcript runs off the right end of the linearized plasmid , as demonstrated by the reduction in the size of the product when the plasmid is cleaved at the HindIII site , reducing the size of the right end by 17 bp -LRB- Fig . 4 , lane 9 -RRB- . A 170 base transcript of unknown origin -LRB- marked x in Fig . 4 -RRB- is produced in the presence of RNA polymerase and only in the absence of CRP . The product originates from a region near the left end of the PFGH fragment and it terminates within the vector -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . It is not clear if this transcript is produced in vivo , and it is not always seen with in vitro reactions . -LRB- e -RRB- DNase footprint of the araFGH promoter The binding sites for the transcriptional activator proteins were located by DNase I protection assay . The araFGH DNA fragment of pWH54 was labeled on the bottom strand at the HindIII site , and the binding sites for AraC protein and CRP were determined -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . AraC protein protected two regons of approximately 40 bp each . One region extends from - 60 to - 103 , while the other is found at - 136 to - 178 . Since the function of these sites is not known , they have been designated araFG1 for the site centered at - 81 and araFG2 for the site at - 157 . At a low concentration of AraC protein the araFG2 site was fully occupied , while no protection of araFG1 was observed . This suggests that the affinity of FG2 for AraC protein is higher than the affinity of FG1 , which is opposite the relative affini - araFGH and araJ Promoters 503 AroC : CRP : 2.5 0.5 I - 5 3 - 0 0 - , 5 I - 5 5 - 0 3.0 - -- 2 '' 5 2 - 5 2 - 5 2 - 5 J m ' aFGH -LRB- Sinai -RRB- oroFGH -LRB- Hlndn ' r -RRB- RNAZ Figure 4 .

Single - round transcription reactions were performed in buffer containing cAMP and L - arabinose . Proteins were bound for l0 rain and transcription was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 ° C . All reactions contained 5 nM - RNA polymerase plus the indicated concentrations , given in nM - active protein , of CRP and AraC protein . ties of the ara02 and araI s -LRB- tes at PShD -LRB- Hendrickson & Schleif , 1984 -RRB- . A weak enhanced cleavage was seen at - 67 and strongly enhanced cleavage occurred at -- 77 and 98 . Similarly sized footprints were obtained for reactions performed with DNA labeled on the top strand -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- . AraC protection was from - 55 to - 100 and from - 136 to - 173 . Enhanced cleavage occurred at - 71 and - 92 in the FGI site and at - 133 , - 146 and - 167 in FG2 . The footprint of the FG2 site was obtained by labeling DNA at the AspT18 restriction site just upstream from FG2 , and the reaction products were analyzed on 20 % polyacrylamide gels -LRB- not shown -RRB- . Incubation of AraC protein with DNA in the absence of arabinose also produced a footprint identical with that seen in the presence of the sugar , although an increased amount of protein was required -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- b -RRB- , lane 10 -RRB- . The footprinting data are summarized in Figure 2 . CRP - cAMP protected a region of 22 bp of the bottom strand from - 32 to - 54 , and enhanced cleavage occurred at - 51 and - 52 -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . On the top strand 24 bp fl ' om - 29 to - 52 were protected , and cleavage at - 53 was strongly enhanced -LRB- Fig . 5 -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- . When both AraC and CRP were present , the entire region fl ' om - 29 to - 100 was protected . The region protected by CRP contains a sequence that matches the CRP consensus at 14 out of 22 positions including eight out of the ten most highly conserved bases -LRB- Berg & von Hippel , 1988 -RRB- . The CRP binding sequence is centered 41 '' 5 bp upstream from the araFGH tran - scriptional start , which places the right one - half of the site in the - 35 region of the promoter . -LRB- f -RRB- Transcription from the araJ promoter The transcription start point and relative amounts of cellular RNA produced by the promoter identified on plasmid pBEK9 were determined by SI nuclease mapping . I % NA was extracted from uninduced cells , cells induced by arabinose for various times , cells exposed to the anti - inducer D - fucose and arabinose - induced cells deleted of adenyl cyclase . Figure 6 shows the results of these assays , as well as a '' G '' sequencing reaction that was done on the same DNA to provide a size standard . Only one arabinose - induced hybrid to the bottom strand is apparent in the range of _ _ _ 125 bases of the possible transcription start points identified in vitro -LRB- Kosiba & Schleif , 1982 -RRB- . Hybridization to the other strand showed no evidence of an arabinose - induced transcript . The DNA fragments of the bottom strand protected by the hybridized RNA varied in size by seven bases . After correction of the 1.5 base migration velocity difference between $ 1 digested DNA and the chemically modified size standard DNA -LRB- Hentschel et al . , 1980 -RRB- , the fragments were seen to range in size from 156 to 163 bases . The various sizes of protected DNA might be thought to arise from incomplete S 1 digestion , but variation of the nuclease concentration from 15 to 40 units , a concentration that almost eliminated the protected504 W .

For numbering the nucleotides of the DNA , we take position l of the mRNA to correspond to a transcript of 161 bases . Such an assignment maximizes the similarity in sequence and position of this start site with other characterized start sites -LRB- Hawley & McClure , 1983 ; Harley & Reynolds , 1987 -RRB- . On the basis of the findings thati the promoter located on the chromosome produces an arabinose - regulated transcript in vivo , and that it is not at either the araE or araFGH loci , we name the promoter araPj and tentatively name the operon araJ . Figure 6 also shows that Pj is almost fully induced within two minutes of arabinose addition , and its induction increases only slightly over the next 150 minutes . Similar to the other ara operons , induction of Pj requires AraC protein , arabinose plus cAMP - CRP , and no induction is observed in cells incubated with the anti - inducer D - fucose . -LRB- g -RRB- Footprints of araP ~ The binding sites for AraC protein and CRP - cAMP complex were determined by DNase I1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101112 13 a - 40 '' - 20 - i ! . 20 - 40 '' 60 . 6 Figure 6 .

44074408 Biochemistry : Cai et al . ends of the metE and metR mRNAs and end - labeled with -LSB- y - 32PJATP . The transcriptional start sites for the metE and metR genes were determined by the primer - extension procedure as described by Berthiolet et al . . DNA for MetR footprinting was prepared from pRSE562 . The plasmid was digested with restriction enzymes Sma I and Bgl II to liberate a 710 - base - pair -LRB- bp -RRB- restriction fragment that contained the majority of the metR gene and 162 bp of upstream DNA . This fragment was isolated from an agarose gel and further digested with Sty I to yield a smaller fragment of 290 bp containing 162 bp of upstream DNA and 128 bp of DNA encoding the 5 ' end of metR . Reverse transcriptase was used to end label the Sty I 5 ' overhang . For a calibration ladder , an aliquot of the labeled DNA was treated by the Maxam - Gilbert cleavage method . DNA for MetJ footprinting was prepared from plasmid pMM450 , which contains the metEmetR intergenic sequence upstream of the 83 - galactosidase coding sequence . To obtain pMM450 , the vector pMC1403 was digested with Sma I to allow the insertion of the intergenic sequence from pRSE562 . This construction placed the intergenic sequence between two unique restriction sites , BamHI and EcoRI . For footprinting , the BamHI / EcoRI fragment was purified from an agarose gel . Reverse transcriptase was used to end label the fragment , and a secondary cleavage was performed with Nru I to generate an - 292 - bp fragment , labeled at the BamHI -LRB- metR -RRB- end . This fragment contains 50 bp of DNA encoding metE , the metE - metR intergenic region , and 6 bp of DNA encoding metR . The labeled DNA fragments for MetR and MetJ binding were used for DNase I protection footprinting experiments by a modified procedure of Galas and Schmitz .

In contrast to the role as a specific inhibitor for the in vitro oriC plasmid replication , the fact that there is no detectable phenotype in the iciA null mutant may suggest that IciA protein functions as an inhibitor under certain physiological circumstances that may affect the initiation of chromosomal replication at oriC . 
The results described here suggest that relatively subtle functional effects are easily detectable in vivo , allowing us to probe the physiological requirements of balancing DNA affinity and protein -- protein co - operativity in this system .

Although the first possibility is argued for the regulatory proteins in catabolic and biosynthetic pathways , the latter possibility is proposed not only for the appearance of regulatory protein before the development of such pathways , but also for the regulatory proteins appeared at the later stage where dual specificity for signal molecule and nucleic acid is required , with the reasoning that there would have been many more DNA binding proteins in comparison to the number of specific effector binding proteins even at the later stage -LRB- Savageau , 1979 -RRB- .

Hence rpiB will be redesignated alsI . 
However , only 27 out of the promoters showed increased transcription under at least two of the aforementioned conditions and eight of those were previously known to be directly activated . 
Clearly there is a component -LRB- 13 - to 20 - fold -RRB- to the activation by CRP at rhaSR that is independent of both - CTD and RhaR and hence does not function by the same mechanism used at simple class I CRP - dependent promoters , nor does it function through cooperative binding with RhaR .

ThreenagE -- lacZ fusions were tested : the standard ` loop - forming ' nagBE -- lacZ fusion , whose expression is repressed by NagC binding co - operatively to the nagE and nagB operators ; and two single operator nagE -- lacZ fusions , missing the nagB promoter / operator , but carrying the same nagE -- lacZ junction . 
Amplified fragments were electroporated into the appropriate strains expressing λ red operon from conditional plasmid pKD46 -LRB- Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 -RRB- . 
The arrowheads indicate the extended bands . 
We deduced from the differences between the A and B sites in DNA sequence and in binding behavior that the B site may possess a greater affinity for P2 than the A site . 
This implies that cellobiose can not induce the chb operon in the presence of a nagC + allele . 
The figure shows a DNase I footprint experiment that examines the binding of purified phospho - NarL and IHF proteins to the pnir7150 fragment with time . 
As a consequence , the position of the phosphate between bases 12 and 13 will be altered relative to the surface of the DNA . 
C . and Liao , J . 
Both plasmids directed enough synthesis of the metJ gene product to greatly repress the met regulon and thus impose a methionine requirement on their host strain . 
Here we show that MelR binding to this site can downregulate expression from the melR promoter ; thus , MelR autoregulates its own expression . 
Thus , the repressive effects of IHF binding at the IHF I site are moderated by IHF binding at a neighbouring site . 
We found that ArgP does bind to the regulatory regions of dnaA and nrdA in vitro with moderate affinity but that it does not regulate their transcription in vivo . 
DNase I Protection Assay -- The standard reaction -LRB- 25 l -RRB- contained 40 mM HEPES / KOH -LRB- pH 7.6 -RRB- , 50 mM potassium chloride , 10 mM magnesium acetate , 0.1 mM ATP , 2.5 g of bovine serum albumin , 10 % glycerol , 20 fmol of the indicated 32 P - end - labeled DNA fragments , and the indicated amounts of proteins . 
Because metBL and metJ are divergently transcribed , promoters for both of them are likely to be found between the coding sequences of the two genes . 
Chitobiose is the b1 -- 4 linked dimer of N - acetylglucosamine -LRB- GlcNAc -RRB- and it is the major breakdown product of chitin degradation .

The slope of this line gives the net number of salt , ions displaced . The slope of this line is - 3.6 for RhaR binding to ps , , indicating that a net of approximately four monovalent salt ions are displaced from the psr binding site upon RhaR binding . -LRB- e -RRB- RhaR makes speci $ c DNA contacts to its pSr binding site We used chemical interference assays -LRB- Hendrickson & Schleif , 1984 ; Brunelle & Schleif , 1987 -RRB- to determine the nucleotides and phosphate residues to which RhaR makes specific contacts . The results of the contact experiments are summarized in Figure 5 . RhaR apparently makes close contacts to ten phosphate groups . On the top strand , phosphate contacts are made on the 5 ' side of bases - 80 , - 79 , - 69 , - 68 and - 38 . On the bottom strand , the phosphate groups on the 5 ' side of bases - 33 , - 34 , - 44 , - 45 and - 75 are contacted -LRB- Fig . 4 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- . The pattern of the contacts is symmetrical and is centered within the half sites of the inverted repeat sequences . There are no phosphate contacts apparent to the spacer DNA between the half sites . Methylation of the N - 7 position of guanine nucleotides in the major groove and the N - 3 of adenine nucleotides in the minor groove revealed four guanine contacts but no adenine contacts . On the top strand , RhaR makes close contact with a guanine nucleotide at position - 47 . On the bottom strand , RhaR closely contacts the guanine nucleotides at position - 80 , - 67 and - 45 -LRB- Fig . 4 -LRB- b -RRB- -RRB- . These contacts are restricted to the half sites of inverted repeat sequence . No strong contacts are evident in the spacer region between the sites . The missing contact approach -LRB- Brunelle & Schleif , 1987 -RRB- provides information about contacts made to all four nucleotides , whereas the premethylation experiment gives information only about close approaches to guanine and adenine bases . Additionally , a bulky methyl group on guanine could easily interfere with binding , even though a specific hydrogen bond is not made to that position . The missing contact experiment does not have this shortcoming , in that the base is completely removed . The result of an experiment examining both purine and pyrimidine contacts is illustrated by Figure 4 -LRB- c -RRB- . On the top strand , the removal of T81 , C80 , T79 , T78 , G47 , A40 , and T39 , G34 and G33 has a significant effect on binding . On the bottom strand , G80 , T76 , T75 , 82 J . F . Tobin and R . F . Schleif Bottom TOP F 6 BF : -- 36 - 69 - 66 -LRB- 01 Fig . 4 . G45 , T36 , T35 , C34 and C33 are apparently contacted by RhaR . Again , the distinguishing feature of these contacts is that they are located within the inverted repeat half sites and that no detectable contacts are made to the spacer region . The affinity of RhaR for the pSr binding site is 15fold lower in the absence of L - rhamnose . This reduced affinity could be due to altered or missing DNA contacts made by the protein in the absence of L - rhamnose , but a contact experiment performed in the absence of L - rhamnose revealed an identical pattern of contacts to those performed in the presence of L - rhamnose -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . Therefore . within the limits of the assay , the lower affinity can not be attributed to altered or missing contacts . Figure 5 -LRB- b -RRB- displays the contacts on a DNA helix that has a helical repeat of 10.5 base - pairs . The contacts are distributed across two major grooves at each of the 20 base - pair half sites , with the major & y of the contacts found within the distal major groove at each half site . The other feature of the contacts is that they are restricted t , o one face of the DKA . TheProperties qf RhaR 83 Bottom G TOP - 67 -LRB- b -RRB- Fig . 4 . symmetrical pattern of the contacts agrees well with an inverted repeat structure and can not be fit to a direct repeat binding site . -LRB- f -RRB- The RhaR - DNA complex forms a DNA microloop The RhaR contacts to the pSl site are unusual , in that the protein makes no contacts to the 17 basepair DNA sequence between the half sites of the inverted repeat . This unusual pattern of contacts would be expected if RhaR bound to the pSr binding site by making contacts to the two half sites while looping out the intervening spacer DNA . Insertion of helical turns of DNA between the respective operator sites in the ara -LRB- Dunn et al . , 1984 -RRB- and lambda systems -LRB- Hochschild & Ptashne , 1986 -RRB- affects looping . Insertion of a non - integral number of helical turns drastically interferes with looping , whereas insertion of an integral number of helical turns has a much smaller effect . In both systems , the DNA sites required for looping need to be positioned on the same face of the DNA . We measured the affinity of RhaR for mutant sites containing an integral or non - integral number of helical turns between the half sites . Mutant pSl binding sites were constructed by inserting an additional 11 , 15 and 33 base - pairs into the 17 base - pair spacer region between the two half sites . As expected for a looped structure , RhaR binds considerably less tightly to a DNA molecule containing a non - integral number of84 J . F . Tobin and R , F .

DNA loop , which most likely would be bent , we used the gel electrophoresis assay developed by Wu & Crothers to look for a bend in the psr binding site . Figure 6 shows that the mobility of RhaR - p , , DNA complexes is dependent on the position of the binding site with respect to the ends of a set of DNA molecules of the same length . This is expected for bent DNA , and the alteration in migration velocity as a function of the position of the binding site permits estimation of the bending angle -LRB- Thompson & Landy , 1988 -RRB- . The DNA alone contains a static bend in the absence of bound RhaR .

We estimated the bending angle to be 70 '' using the method described by Thompson & Landy . In the presence of RhaR protein , the retardation as a function of the location of the binding site is much larger , and the bending angle appears to be 160 '' . 4 . Discussion To obtain sufficient quantities of RhaR for study of its DNA binding activities , we hypersynthesized the protein using the strong bacterial tat promoter . Binding experiments performed previously -LRB- Tobin & Schleif , 1987 -RRB- and those performed in this study shovired that RhaR binds specifically to the inverted repeat element contained upstream from the psi promoter . The binding is independent of RhaS . A truncated RhaR protein lacking the carboxyterminal portion of RhaR fails to bind but displays a trans dominant negative phenotype . This result suggests that the carboxy - terminal domain of RhaR is involved in DNA binding and that the aminote '' rmina1 portion is involved in oligomerization -LRB- Isackson & Bertrand , 1985 ; Nelson et al . , 1987 -RRB- .

The relative mobility of pS , DNA and RhaR - p , , DNA complexes in a 6 '' / b polyacrylamide gel is dependent , on the position of the DNA binding site . The 787 base - pair minicircle -LRB- Materials and Methods -RRB- was digested with -LRB- H -RRB- HindIII , -LRB- E -RRB- EeoRI , -LRB- M -RRB- MZuI , or BumHI to produce a set of DNA fragments of the same size containing the RhaR binding site at different positions within the fragment . The bands of greater intensity are the circaularly permuted fragments containing the RhaR DNA - binding site . The bands of lesser intensity arise from cleavage of the unligated -LRB- linear -RRB- 787 base - pair Hind111 fragment . The additional band -LRB- slowest mobility -RRB- present in the H lanes is undigested minicircle DNA . carboxy - terminal truncated RhaS protein also displays a trans dominant negative phenotype , indicating that its active form may be an oligomer . We have not been able to detect any binding of RhaS to DNA -LRB- data not shown ; see Tobin , 1989 -RRB- . The RhaR protein was purified by a simple twocolumn procedure using the gel shift assay to monitor the purification steps . Since no assay was available for the RhaS protein , its purification was not attempted . The RhaR purification procedure consists of three steps . The cells are lysed by the addition of lysozyme . After this step , most of the RhaR act , ivity is associated with the cell pellet . This is not surprising , since RhaR is a DNA - binding protein and most of the cellular DNA is contained in this pellet . High - salt extraction of this pellet , followed by DNA removal , left a crude extract containing RhaR at approximately @ 2 % of the total cellular protein . Cellulose - phosphate chromatography and DNA affinity chromatography resulted in a RhaR preparation that was 7O '' / b homogeneous containing predominantly a 33 kDa protein and a lesser amount of a 100 kDa protein . Further purification was not attempted because the yield was too low at this point . The 33 kDa protein was shown to be RhaR since it , and not the 100 kDa protein , was found in RhaR - DNA complexes . The nature of the 100 kDa protein that copurifies with RhaR is not known . It does not comigrate with any of the subunits of purified RNA polymerase on an SDS / polyacrylamide gel . We determined several of the physical properties of the purified RhaR protein using the gel shift assay . A general property of DNA - binding regulatory proteins is that they specifically bind to DNA with affinities in the nanomolar to plcomolar range . Such high affinities easily allow these proteins to discriminate between non - specific and specific DNA binding sites at the in vivo concentrations of these proteins . The equilibrium binding constants and kinetic constants of RhaR for t -RRB- he psr site were determined under a variety of solution conditions . These experiments showed that RhaR binds tight -RSB- ? . to its site with Kapp ranging from t , he subpicomolar to the ten picomolar range .

Electrophoresis continued for a total of 180 min . beled DNAs containing three different embedded sites : araI - araI , direct repeat of the half - sites , araI single repeat half - site , and nonspecific DNA . At equal protein concentration , the ZipDImCI - AraCDNA chimera formed a distinct specific complex with the direct repeat araI - araI site but not with the other DNA samples . The same was true of wild - type AraC . These results indicate that both of the DNA domains of the ZipDIJU _ r - AraCDNA chimera can contact DNA specifically . Activation by the AraC DNA - Binding Domain . The preceding sections showed that the C - terminal half of the AraC protein comprises a domain capable of specific binding to DNA when it is connected to a dimerizing domain . Does the DNA - binding domain also possess the determinants necessary for activating transcription ? We tested this possibility by cotransforming a plasmid carrying a pB , 4D4acZ fusion and the plasmid encoding the ZiPDJDir - ArCDNA hybrid protein into cells deleted of the araC and lacZ genes . Introduction of the chimeric ZipDj . . , - AraCDNA increased the 3 - galactosidase levels 30 - fold , from 200 units to 6100 units , indicating that the chimeric protein binds to the araI site and activates PBAID in vivo .

This is as expected because AraC occupancy of the half - site closer to the RNA polymerase binding site is necessary for induction , but this half - site binds AraC only weakly -LRB- 13 , 27 -RRB- . To test whether the DNA - binding domain by itself could activate , we used a promoter generated in a previous study in which the half - site closest to the RNA polymerase has been changed to the more tightly binding sequence araI . The overall araIj - araI site has been repositioned by two bases so that the - 35 region of the promoter is still functional . This araI - araI site was activated 100 - fold by wild - type AraC and 90 - fold by ZiPNmcr AraCDNA . The AraC DNA - binding domain without a dimerization domain was able to stimulate this promoter 15 - fold . These results indicate that the C - terminal domain of AraC contains the information required to activate transcription ; however , it fails to activate the araI - araI2 wildtype promoter because it is unable to interact with an araI2 half - site . Our results are in general agreement with previous work by Menon and Lee which demonstrated that the C - terminal domain of AraC contained the information required to bind and activate transcription of the araBAD genes . A B A Trans - Domain Interaction Between the AraC Dimerization Domain and the LexA DNA - Binding Domain . Results from earlier experiments -LRB- see Discussion -RRB- imply that the dimerization domain of AraC binds arabinose . These results also suggest that arabinose generates a substantial conformational change in AraC . Therefore , it seemed possible that the presence of arabinose could have a detectable effect on the AraCDiJRer - LexADNA chimera . Remarkably , an effect , although small , was observed , both in vivo and in vitro . The addition of arabinose to cells containing the p5uL4 - lacZ fusion and AraCDimer - LexADNA increased repression of 3 - galactosidase synthesis -LRB- Fig . SA -RRB- about 2 - fold . Neither the indicator strain itself nor the strain containing LexA showed a similar response to arabinose . In vitro experiments also showed that arabinose increased the binding of AraCDimer - LexADNA to the LexA operator . AraCDimer - LexADNA / DNA complex did not form when a cell extract from the untransformed strain was present nor when a 100 - fold molar excess of unlabeled specific competitor DNA was added to the binding reaction mixture before the labeled DNA . Detectable amounts of the AraCDimcr - LexADNA / DNA complex formed only when arabinose was included in the binding assay buffer . This was added immediately or after 10 min to demonstrate that arabinose was not 1.2 - 0 CZ ' ' C1 -RRB- 3 ~ E a , i ? D O0 in t 0.8 , 0 -- 0.4 0 c ? - + 4 ...

These results indicate that an arabinose - binding site is located in the dimerization domain in the N - terminal half of AraC and that this domain undergoes a change upon the addition of arabinose that affects the DNA - binding properties of a heterologous DNA - binding domain attached by a linker . DISCUSSION The experiments described here show that functional chimeric proteins can be constructed in which either their dimerization and arabinose - responsive abilities derive from the N - terminal half of AraC protein or their DNA - binding and transcription - activation abilities originate from the C - terminal half of AraC . Thus , functional domains of AraC specifying these four activities have been located . The experiments were designed to locate dimerization and DNA - binding domains , and it was not expected that these same chimeric proteins would also allow localization of the transcriptionactivation and arabinose - binding portions of AraC . The approach and constructs we used should prove useful in defining the minimum sequences for dimerization and DNA binding and may also be useful in the additional localization of the portions of the protein involved with arabinose binding and transcriptional activation . As mentioned in the introduction , direct biochemical probing has located amino acid - DNA - base contacts between residues 208 and 212 ofAraC and one of the two major groove regions of the DNA half - site that is contacted by each monomer of the AraC dimer . The location of the amino acids that contact the second major groove of each half - site is unknown . Our localization of all the amino acids necessary for specific DNA binding restricts the structure that contacts DNA to the second half of AraC but leaves unanswered the role of a second potential helix - turn - helix region that begins at amino acid 256 . Notwithstanding the results in this paper showing that the N - terminal half of AraC can participate in specific dimer formation , our results do not eliminate the possibility that in vivo the DNA - binding domains themselves of both AraC and LexA are unstable and are stabilized , but not dimerized , by additional protein . Then , while it is true that AraC is dimeric in vitro -LRB- 32 , 34 -RRB- and normally requires both half - sites for binding to DNA in vivo -LRB- 20 , 27 -RRB- , our experiments could have misidentified the relevant dimerization domain of AraC . This possibility appears unlikely because other studies utilizing the DNA - binding domains of A repressor or LexA found that dimerization by domains from GNC4 , Fos , and Jun proteins was required for binding to their respective operators -LRB- 10 , 14 , 15 -RRB- , the same result on which we base our conclusion of dimerization . Thus , the ability of AraCDjIIXC - LexADNA , but not the LexA DNA - binding domain , to repress PsuU - lacZ was more likely the result of the protein ' s dimerization . Previous work suggested that arabinose does not directly affect the DNA binding of AraC by altering the structure of the DNA - contacting part of the protein . The experiments described here demonstrate that this is the case . The addition of arabinose had a measurable effect on the binding of AraCDiJBCr - LexADNA to the DNA . Since it has been inferred and directly shown -LRB- J . Withey and R . F . S . , unpublished work -RRB- that arabinose does not affect dimerization of AraC monomers , the effect of arabinose on the binding of AraCDimCl - LexADNA to the LexA operator most likely is the result of a conformational change in the N - terminal part of the protein . A similar trans - domain ligand - induced response has been observed in fusion proteins carrying the LexA DNAbinding domain and the hormone - binding site of the glucocorticoid receptor . Proc . Natl . Acad Sci . USA 90 In summary , functional chimeras have been constructed in which the N - terminal half of AraC provided dimerization and arabinose responsiveness and the C - terminal half provided binding and transcription - activation capabilities . The construction of such functional chimeras demonstrates that AraC possesses a modular structure , with independent domains capable of dimerizing and of binding to DNA . We are grateful to Drs .

Karen Beemon for comments on the manuscript , to the members of the laboratory for critical discussion and comments on the manuscript , and to Jeff Withey for technical assistance .

Either Lrp or VpsR is capable of achieving nearly full expression of the aphA promoter , but when present together their effects are to some degree additive . 
Eight amino acids of the αCTD are required for activation of fumC , and of these , six are within or near the 265 determinant . 
This activation of transcription was lost when the assays were performed in a strain carrying the chromosomal nagC and a disruption of chbR , Fig . 7 . 
Similarly , JF201 -LRB- chbR : : cat -RRB- was constructed by transducing the chbR : : cat allele from the parent DY330 -LRB- chbR : : cat -RRB- into JF201 .

Frameshift mutations within and subcloning of the gutM and gutR genes . The top diagram shows the location of the genes and the restriction map . The middle diagram shows the frameshift -LRB- F ' s -RRB- mutations , and the bottom diagram illustrates the subcloning of the genes . pMYS178 , pMYS181 and pMYS182 contain the frameshift mutations , and these plasmids are derived from pMYS24 -LRB- Yamada & Saier , 19875 -RRB- . The positions of the frameshift mutations are indicated by FS -LRB- x -RRB- . In the subclones below pMYS182 , straight lines indicate the DNA fragments from pMYS24 which were inserted into pUC18 , except for pMYS199 in which pUC19 was used . The right part indicates the existence of the functional genes on the plasmids . Circles and arrows -LRB- top -RRB- show the transcripts of the gut operon and the gutR gene . BgZII sites were lacking in the two mutants . From these data , we postulate that the upstream open reading frame may encode an activator of the gut operon , GutM , and that the downstream frame may encode the repressor of the operon , GutR . When an additional frameshift mutation was introduced at the BglII site of pMYS178 , which already possessed the Sal1 frameshift mutation , the resultant plasmid -LRB- pMYS182 -RRB- conferred glucitol fermentation to the cells . Enzyme analyses revealed that the gut operon was expressed at a lower level in cells harboring the doubly mutated plasmid than in the cells harboring only the plasmid mutated at the BgZII site . These results lead to the conclusion that the products of the two open reading frames downstream from g & D function as positive and negative regulatory proteins of gut operon expression , respectively . -LRB- b -RRB- Effect of the gutM gene product in trans on expression of the gut operon To confirm the identity of the gutM gene and to examine the trans . activity of the gene product on expression of the gut operon , several fragments were subcloned into pUC18 which belongs to a different incompatibility group than pACYC177 . For example , pMYS60 was obtained by incorporation of the AZuI -LRB- within the gutD gene -RRB- - AZuI -LRB- position 1015 -RRB- fragment -LRB- 1.0 kb -RRB- into the SmaI site of pUC18 . These clones were introduced into strain 236sr harboring pMYS178 , the gut operon plasmid containing the frameshift mutation in gutM . Cells harboring pMYS60 -LRB- M -RRB- or pMYS162 -LRB- BDM -RRB- in addition to pMYS178 exhibited glucitol fermentation and expressed both phosphotransferase and glucitol - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activities -LRB- and data not shown -RRB- . Although the gut operon seemed to be expressed constitutively in double transformants , the high level of gut operon expression observed when cells were grown without glucitol could have been due to the high copy number of the gutM gene on pUC18 relative to that of the gutR gene on pACYC177 . When pMYS60 , carrying the gutM gene , was introduced into LJ1008 -LRB- mtl - -RRB- , the chromosomal gut operon was partially expressed in the absence of glucitol . -LRB- c -RRB- Effect of the gutR gene product in trans on expression of the gut operon Figure 3 also illustrates the subcloning of the gutR gene . When the subclone , pMYS135 or pMYS199 , was introduced into strain 236sr carrying pMYS181 , which has a frameshift mutation at the BglII site within gutR , glucitol fermentation was reduced . These results were confirmed by enzyme analyses . Therefore , the gutR gene , encoding the repressor of the gut operon , is located in the SalI - EcoRV fragment -LRB- 1.4 kb -RRB- as deduced from the nucleotide sequence . Experiments with the frameshift mutants and the subcloning experiments clearly indicate that the gutM and gutR genes are distinct . -LRB- d -RRB- Effects of the gutM and gutR gene products on gut operon transcription . The effects of the gutM and gutR gene products on gut operon mRNA synthesis were examined by the reverse transcriptase mapping method -LRB- Bina - Figure 2 .

The primer used for mapping was prepared as described -LRB- Yamada & Saier , 1987a -RRB- . The primer consisted of the 98 - base anti - sense strand corresponding to the BstEII - RsaI fragment that is located near the N terminus of the Enzyme ZZeuL gene fused to a 36 base strand from mp19 , since it was prepared from the recombinant that had an insertion of the chromosomal ' Rsa1 fragment into mp19 -LRB- Yamada & Saier , 1987a -RRB- . The crude RNA used was isolated from cells harboring pMYS24 -LRB- ABDMR -RRB- , pMYSl78 -LRB- ABDM - R -RRB- , pMYS181 -LRB- ABDMR - -RRB- and pMYS182 -LRB- ABDM - R - -RRB- , which were grown both in the presence and absence of glucitol . mRNA from pMYS24 -LRB- g & M + and gutR + -RRB- was detected only when the cells were grown in the presence of glucitol . On the other hand , mRNA was detected from neither induced nor uninduced cells harboring pMYS178 -LRB- g & M - and gutR + -RRB- . These facts are + gut - gut I I I !

Effect of the gutM and gutR gene PI moducts on the transcription of the gutR gene . Details a tre the same as for Fig . 5 . qualitatively coincident with the results of enzyme assays . Therefore , the results suggest that the gutM gene product functions as a transcriptional activator of the gut operon . The increased activity and mRNA level in the pMYSl81 -LRB- M + R - -RRB- - carrying strain grown without glucitol relative to that grown with glucitol is probably due to catabolite repression by glucitol . In agreement with the enzyme assays -LRB- Table l -RRB- , gut operon mRNA was detected from both induced and uninduced cells harboring pMYS181 -LRB- gut & f + and gutR - -RRB- or pMYS182 -LRB- gutM - and gutR - -RRB- . The intensities of the mRNA bands correlated fairly well with the enzyme activities . Maximal induction occurred when the g & M gene product but not the gutR gene product was present . -LRB- e -RRB- Transcriptional start site of the gutR gene The transcriptional start sites of the gutR gene were determined by reverse transcriptase mapping as shown in Figures 4 and 6 . The primer used for the mapping was the 123 - base anti - sense strand -LRB- positions 893 to 1015 -RRB- fused to a 58 - base strand from mp18 , since the primer was prepared from the recombinant that had an insertion of the AZuI fragment from pMYS178 -LRB- ABDM - R -RRB- into mp18 . Crude RNA was isolated as described for the experiment reported in Figure 5 . In the induced state , mRNA from all of the strains studied was detected in nearly the same amounts . A mRNA start site was located within the gutM gene . mRNA from the gutR - strains -LRB- cells harboring pMYS181 or pMYS182 -RRB- appeared to be four basepairs longer compared to the gutR + strains -LRB- cells harboring pMYS24 or pMYS178 -RRB- as expected since four base - pairs were inserted upon introduction of the frameshift mutation . Although in the uninduced state , the transcriptional start site was found to be the same as that in the induced state , the intensity of the bands from pMYS24 -LRB- ABDMR -RRB- and pMYS181 -LRB- ABDMR - -RRB- was weaker and stronger , respectively , compared to those of the induced state . To determine the mRNA start site of the gutM gene , the primer was prepared from the clone in which the KpnI -LRB- within the gutA gene -RRB- - Sal1 -LRB- position 549 -RRB- fragment was inserted into the KpnI - Sal1 site of mp18 . The primer prepared consisted of the 49 - base anti - sense strand from the DraI - Sal1 fragment fused to the 58 - base strand from mp18 . However , we could not detect mRNA bands corresponding to the region from the C terminus of the glucitol - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase to the N terminus of the activator -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . -LRB- f -RRB- Transcriptional analysis using the cat gene cartridge As shown in Figure 7 , several insertion mutants were constructed employing the cat gene cartridge -LRB- Close & Rodriguez , 1982 -RRB- . Insertion of the cat gene cartridge into the regulatory genes led to changes in the fermentation phenotype as described above for the frameshift mutants . Compared to cells harboring the parental plasmid , pMYS24 , insertion of the cat gene into the gutR gene gave rise to576 M . Yamada and M . H .

The positions of insertion are indicated by triangles . Broken lines show the deleted portions . Sites of restriction enzymes cleavage correspond to those shown in Fig . 3 . increased fermentation , while insertion into the g & M gene resulted in reduced fermentation . Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase -LRB- CAT -RRB- activity as well as glucitol - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activity was measured using extracts from these insertion mutants . pMYS187 has the insertion in the g & R gene at the BgEII site of pMYS24 . pMYS201 was derived from a plasmid bearing a deletion -LRB- between the BamHI and KpnI sites of pMYS187 -RRB- so that it lacked the operator - promoter region of the gut operon as well as the upstream portion of the gutA gene , encoding the N terminus of the Enzyme IIg '' ` . As for the gutR frameshift mutant at the BgZII site , cells harboring pMYS187 showed high - level constitutive expression of glucitol - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activity . When pMYS199 carrying the gutR gene co - existed with pMYS187 , the dehydrogenase became inducible . On the other hand , cells harboring pMYS201 showed negligible dehydrogenase activity but low - level constitutive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity . Therefore , it ' seems that the gutD gene does not have its own promoter , but ' that ' the gutR gene does . Since there was no significant effect of pMYS199 on chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression in cells harboring pMYS201 , the product of t , he gutR gene seems to have little or no effect on expression initiated at the gutR - specific promoter . Similar experiments were carried out using pMYS204 , which was derived by insertion of the cat gene into t , he gutM gene at the SaEI site of pMYS24 and using pMYS206 , which was made by deletion of the BamHI - KpnI fragment of pMYS204 -LRB- Figs 3 and 7 -RRB- . The experiment revealed that expression of the cat gene from pMYS204 -LRB- ABDM - R -RRB- was dependent on the co - existence of the gutM gene in tram and the inducer , glucitol . When the operator - promoter of the gut operon was deleted , the cat gene was not expressed under the same conditions -LRB- i . e . in the case of pMYS206 -RRB- .

Both regulatory genes are therefore constituents of the gut operon . -LRB- g -RRB- The coding region for the activator The gutM gene seems to start within a REP sequence -LRB- Yamada & Saier , 1987a -RRB- . The initiation codon of the gene may be the ATG at positions 353 to 355 . The sequence -LRB- TAAGGA -RRB- , homologous to the Shine - Dalgarno sequence , exists at positions 341 to 346 -LRB- underlined in Fig . 2 -RRB- . The open reading frame starting at position 353 continues to position 709 . We could not find a typical transcriptional terminator signal in the region between the 3 ' end of the gutM gene and the 5 ' end of the gutR gene . -LRB- h -RRB- The promotor region of the gutR gene The reverse transcriptase mapping experiment revealed that mRNA of the gutR gene starts at the G in position 592 . The putative gutR promoter sequence may be TCTTCG as the - 10 sequence and TTGTTT as the - 35 sequence . -LRB- i -RRB- The coding region for the repressor Although the mRNA initiation site of the gutR gene exists within the g & M gene , the open reading frame begins after it . The initiation codon of the gene may be ATG at positions 779 to 781 . The sequence , T - AGG - , homologous to the Shine - Dalgarno sequence , exists at positions 763 to 768 -LRB- underlined in Fig . 2 -RRB- . The open reading frame of 771 base - pairs , starting at the initiation codon , must be the gutR gene encoding the repressor . After the stop codon of the gutR gene , there are relatively short stem - loop structures followed by an A + Trich sequence which may serve as a p - independent terminator . -LRB- j -RRB- Detection of an additional open reading frame , gut & We noticed that an additional open reading frame exists starting 31 base - pairs after the stop codon of the gutR gene . The sequence homologous to the Shine - Dalgarno sequence of the putative gene would be GGA - GT at positions 1569 to 1574 . Since the stem - loop structures after the gutR gene are relatively short , it is possible that the putative gene is transcribed from the promoter of the gut operon and / or of the gutR gene . This additional gene , tentatively designated gutQ , is predicted to encode a protein of 193 aminoacyl residues and is followed by a REP sequence -LRB- unpublished results -RRB- . A computer search did not reveal appreciable sequence identity between the GutQ protein and other sequenced proteins .

Structural basis for ligand - regulated oligomerization of AraC . 
Although a similar arrangement of sites around the transcription initiation regions of other genes of the gal regulon might have suggested that they all are regulated by a similar mechanism to galE -LRB- Weickert and Adhya , 1993a , b ; Semsey et al . , 2007 -RRB- , the results presented in this paper demonstrate that repression of the galP gene , is mediated by a distinctly different nucleoprotein complex involving NagC as well as GalR and GalS and including at least 280 bp of DNA . 
Concentrations were as follows : RNA polymerase , 1.2 nM ; DNA , 0.6 nM ; AraC , 0.14 nM ; and CAP , 0.2 nM . consistent with interactions between the C - terminal domain of the alpha subunit and both activators , similar to that seen for the natural system at the ansB promoter . 
Thus , microarray analysis does not distinguish primary from secondary effects of the inducer or regulator . 
Activation of both araBAD and melAB requires that the loweraffinity promoter - proximal operator be occupied by AraC or MelR , which occurs in the presence of inducer and cAMP / CAP -LRB- Schleif , 1996 ; Wade et al . , 2001 ; Grainger et al . , 2003 -RRB- . 
The standard curve and the K r values for each protein - DNA complex were used to determine the molecular weights of the complexes .

If the side group of the wild - type amino acid makes a specific protein -- DNA contact with a functional group of the wild - type base pair , then the effect on transcription activation of combining a single alanine substitution of that amino acid of Rob and a single base - pair substitution at that position of the robbox would not be significantly different from that conferred by the more severe of the two individual mutations ; that is , the effect on activation conferred by one mutation would be masked by the effect conferred by the other , and thus , the mutations would be epistatic to one another .

This is likely to be related to the low level of transcription from the endogenous plasmid promoter and the lack of positive autoregulation of chbR expression in the clones . 
There is controversy as to why E . coli possesses so many gluconate transporters , and it is not yet known whether the two gluconate transporters of the GntI system , GntT and GntU , play different roles during growth on gluconate . 
In this scenario , enhanced synthesis would be required to maintain the high growth rate . 
Region 1 , nanR and region 1 - nanR double mutants have similar effects on fimB , and thus neither YjhA , nor transcription directed toward yjhA , apparently affects the recombinase genes expression under the conditions studied here .

In previous work we had noted that MelR - dependent induction of pmelAB in vivo is dependent on melibiose , but that weak Figure 6 0 10 20 30 -LSB- Sugarl -LRB- mM -RRB- Activation of MeIR by arabinose The figure illustrates the activation of pmelAB as a function of arabinose -LRB- @ , A , * -RRB- or melibiose concentration . Activation was judged by , - galactosidase expression in M182 cells carrying pRW50 with the KK43 EcoRl - Hindlll fragment . As a source of meiR the cells also contained pJW1 5 encoding wild - type melR -LRB- - , 0 -RRB- , the KR182 substitution -LRB- R -RRB- or the KN218 substitution -LRB- A -RRB- . Activities were normalized , with 100 % taken as the normal activity with wild - type MeIR plus melibiose . induction is possible with high concentrations of some other sugars -LRB- C . Webster and J . Williams , unpublished work -RRB- . For example , the inclusion of 25 mM arabinose resulted in 10 % induction of pmelAB in the presence of wild - type meiR . Similar assays showed that the GS1 19 , KE123 , QR128 , ST167 and KR182 substitutions resulted in an increase in this arabinosedependent activation . An example of the data is illustrated in Figure 6 , which shows a plot ofpmelAB expression as a function of increasing arabinose concentration . Arabinose - dependent induction with wild - type MelR was weak but was improved severalfold with the KR182 substitution . Interestingly , the KN218 substitution in helix - turn - helix 1 had little effect on arabinose - Escherichia coli MeIR transcription activator protein 763 dependent induction . On the basis of these results , we suggest that the GS1 19 , KE123 , QR128 , ST167 and KR182 substitutions cause a change in MeIR that alters its inducibility with different sugars , whereas the KN218 change is likely to alter DNAbinding preferences . Conclusions MelR is a member of the AraC / XylS family of transcription regulators , a group of at least 27 proteins that , with two exceptions , are all transcription activators . Most members of this family appear to consist of two domains , with the C - terminal segment involved in DNA binding and the N - terminal segment responsible for signal - induced triggering -LRB- Gallegos et al . , 1993 -RRB- . In most cases these proteins bind to tandem copies of 16 - 18 bp operators and activity is triggered by small ligands . Since there is no structural information on any family member , our understanding of how the operator sequences are recognized and how activity is triggered is sketchy . In the case of pmelAB , transcription is dependent on MelR , which binds at two identical 18 bp sequences , organized as an inverted repeat separated by 20 bp Biochem . J . Ebright , R .

DNase I footprinting assays of the napF control region with Fnr -LRB- D154A -RRB- were done as described previously except that acetyl phosphate was not included in the reaction mixtures . 
The araO1 site overlaps the RNA polymerase binding site for Pc , and one set of experiments showed that binding to these two sites was mutually exclusive . 
On this basis , the promoters of the members of the mar regulon were classified into two groups -LRB- Martin et al . , 1999 -RRB- . 
In contrast , IHF does not enhance the ability of NanR to activate fimB expression in the wild - type background .

These ΔmarRAB , rob : : kan strains carry plasmid pRGM9818 -LRB- pMarA -RRB- and pJLR70 -LRB- pSoxS -RRB- -LRB- Martin et al . , 2000 -RRB- which express marA and soxS , respectively , from a plac promoter but also carry an F ' lacI q so that only in the presence of IPTG is MarA or SoxS made . 
This class of DNA binding proteins shares general structural features in the protein DNA binding domain , namely , a pair of similarly oriented a - helices generically termed a helix - turn - helix supersecondary structure -LRB- H - T - H -RRB- which carries out the major role in DNA binding . 
Thus , it is perhaps not surprising that the two promoters are autonomous , and the nrfA -- acs intergenic region must be organized in order to allow both promoters to be expressed independently . 
The more rapid growth rate of MC4100 on galactose compared with the other strains might be correlated with the presence of the spontaneous galOE5 mutation in this strain -LRB- although growth on galactose is expected to bring about loss of GalR / S binding to gal operators -RRB- .

Band F is the uncomplexed DNA and band I is the complex with CAP . 
Purified and phosphorylated CitB binds to the promoter regions of the citrate fermentation genes in vitro . 
In the present case , it is possible that activation of initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase involves further protein - protein interactions between ArgP and RNA polymerase -LRB- Choy & Adhya , 1996 -RRB- . 
Recombinant plasmids with both orientations of the insert with respect to the promoter were obtained . 
In the cases of also detected from pGNTT - LAC2 , and two bands corresponding pGNTT - LAC2 and - LAC4 , bGal activities of the cells in position to the two weak bands were also harboring pGNTR2 were about 15 % of those of control detected from pGNTT - LAC5 -LRB- Fig . 4B and C -RRB- . 
Its expression is regulated by three XylS / AraC family regulators , MarA , SoxS and Rob .

Since one of the functions of TolC is to export toxic compounds , its absence may indirectly trigger a stress - related pathway and activate micF . 
Examination of this and additional footprints allows us to conclude that IHF stimulates NagC binding to O NC1 at least 10 - fold , and that IHF clearly facilitates in vitro the interaction between O NC1 and O NC2 predicted to occur in vivo .

The data therefore suggest that most , if not all , of the important sequences or contacts for ArgP lie within the argO region from approximately 85 to 20 -LRB- whose sequence is underlined and bracketed in Fig . 1A -RRB- . 
In contrast , only weak bands corresponding to the two RNAs were seen in the presence of GntR , cAMP and gluconate , after a long exposure . 
Combined , the data from the in vitro binding studies indicate that Lrp contacts sequences overlapping the ArgP binding site and sequences extending further upstream . 
The experiments described here show , however , that nagC is not effectively regulating manX expression with normal cellular concentrations , because a nagC null mutation produces only a slight increase in manX expression . 
Similarly , at C7 - Gl0 the intervening TA base pairs are not contacted directly , but the position of the displaced phosphate allows a number of hydrogen bonds to be formed with the N - terminal ends of protein alpha helices , which would not be possible if the distortion did not occur .

Adaptation of Escherichia coli to redox environments by gene expression . 
It is obvious that the regulation by anaerobiosis and nitrate of fhe short fusion -LSB- nuO277 -RRB- is not artifactual since it can be attributed to specific reguiators . Possibly the differenf regulafory responses can be explained by the presence of more than one promoter , which might be regulated in different modes . Such a situation applies to the pyruvate formate lyase gene -LRB- pfl -RRB- , which is transcribed from seven promoters -LRB- Sawers and Bock , 1989 -RRB- . Transcriptiona ! stimulation of nuo by electron acceptors : energetic impiications It appears that the expression of the nuo genes is stimulated by eiectron acceptors like O - , nHrate and fumarate . Reduced synthesis of NADH dehydrogenases in fermentative growth is sensible , since NADH can not be reoxidized under these conditions . The energetics of energy conservation in respiration explains the transcriptional activation of nuo by O2 and nitrate , but only io a iimited extent the stimulation by fumarate . In E . coli , three quinones are present under different growth conditions : ubiquinone -LRB- Q -RRB- . menaquinone -LRB- WiK -RRB- and demethyimenaquinone -LRB- DMK -RRB- . It is not known which quinone -LRB- s -RRB- are used as electron acceptors by fhe NADH : quinone oxidoreductase . For energetic reasons , however , only Q and , with restrictions , DMK should be useful as acceptors . The proton - franstocating NADH dehydrogenase I of E . coli is assumed lo operate as a proton pump with a HVe '' ^ 2 , by analogy to complex I from mitochondria -LRB- Matsushita et ai . 1987 ; Wikstrbm . 1984 -RRB- . The energy required for proton translocation against the elecfrochemical H ' gradient -LRB- . Ap = - 180mV -RRB- has to be provided by the redox reaction . For translocation of 2H '' ^ / e '' , a Ae ' > 360mV is required , which can be achieved only with Q and , wifh some restrictions , with DMK as the acceptors . A strict coupling of the redox reaction to proton transiocation -LRB- 2H7e '' -RRB- therefore would exclude MK -LRB- and presumabiy also DMK -RRB- as an electron acceptor . The quinones which donate electrons to fhe different terminal reductases and their occurrence -LRB- Unden , 1988 -RRB- under ihe respective conditions are known . Fumai ' afe , DMSO and TMAO reductases accept electrons only from MK and DMK , nifrate reduetase from Q and DMK and the oxygen reductases from Q -LRB- Wissenbach et af , 1990 ; 1992 ; Anraku and Gennis , 1987 -RRB- . From the known subsfrafe specificities of the terminal reductases , the presumed quinone dependence of NADH dehydrogenase 1 and the quinone availabilities under the different conditions , electron transfer from NADH dehydrogenase I should be possible to the oxygen and nitrate reductases , but not to fumarate reduetase . By these arguments , induction of nuo in aerobic and nitrate respiration , but not in fumarate respiration , is sensible . However , if NADH dehydrogenase I can operate at differenf H7e ratios , NADH - fumarate respirafion would be possible but result in lower energy conservation . 1 ; . 1995 Blackwell Science Ltd , Molecular Microbiology .

Comparison of nuo and ndh expression The expression of the fwo aiternative NADH dehydrogenases I -LRB- nuo -RRB- and 11 -LCB- ndh -RRB- differs with respect to the effecfs of electron donors and transcriplional regulators involved . The non - proton - translocating NADH dehydrogenase II appears to be repressed in anaerobic growth -LRB- Spiro et ai . , 1989 ; Green and Guest , 1994 -RRB- . Both enzymes are expressed aerobicalty and repressed in fermentation . The main difference is She expression during anaerobic respiration , essentially nitrafe respiration , where the H ' '' - translocating NADH dehydrogenase I is the preferred enzyme . Therefore , the latter enzyme should be important for energy conservation and sfatus under these conditions . The explanation for fhe presence of the two dehydrogenases in aerobic metabolism still can not be answered so far , but it could be required for regulation of the NAD -LRB- P -RRB- H / NAD -LRB- P -RRB- ratio or for energy dissipation -LRB- Matsushita et ai . 1987 ; Weiss ef ai . 1991 ; Caihoun et ai , 1993 ; Green and Guest , 1994 -RRB- . The transcriptiona ! regulators for fhe expression of both enzymes are different . The expression of ndb is mainly regulated by FNR -LRB- anaerobic repression -RRB- and by unknown , pulative amino acid response regulators -LRB- Green and Guest . 1994 -RRB- . The regulation of nuo is more complicated , as described here , and it is mainly affected by regulators other than FNR . The regulation by C4 dicarboxylates was not observed for ndh . Therefore , the transcriptional regulation of nuo and ndh are clearly different , and a more detailed understanding of the regulation should also help \ o understand the different physiological functions of both enzymes in fufure .

A -LRB- p -RRB- E -LRB- s -RRB- sin -LRB- 2 2 -RRB- -RSB- + -LSB- E -LRB- c The approximate relative energies of loop formation were determined by an analog technique . We measured the work required to bend elastically a series of flexible steel strips with various lengths , obtained from a surveyor ' s tape , from straight to a conformation in which the ends were a scaled distance of 150 A apart , corresponding to twice the estimated diameter of AraC protein . During this process the ends were not angularly constrained . This freedom corresponds to flexibility in the protein . RESULTS Loop Size Upper Limits . We concentrated on inserting DNA fragments smaller than 2000 bp because separating the aral and araO2 sites by about 2000 bp yielded only repressionnegative derivatives . About 1000 candidates were generated by inserting Hae III fragments of E . coli chromosomal DNA smaller than 1000 bp long into the BstEII site of pTD3 . One hundred and three candidates were repression - positive or partially positive and were examined further . We also chose 41 repression - negative colonies for additional characterization . Fig . 2a shows the relationship between the approximate size of the insertion and the degree of repression as shown on indicating plates in which repression - negative colonies were red and repression - positive colonies were white . In any particular size class of insertions we might expect some to leave araI and araO2 misoriented with respect to the helical face for repression and others to leave these sites correctly oriented . Hence the most significant sizes with respect to repression or lack thereof in any size region of the graph are those that repress best . Apparently , as the loop size increases above 300 bp , . looping or repression becomes increasingly difficult and is lost by about 500 bp . Seven of the 62 different - sized plasmids containing insertions of more than 50 bp were more fully characterized by DNA sequencing and quantitative measurement of repression . Data derived from these plasmids -LRB- Fig . 2b -RRB- agree with their more qualitative characterization . The plasmid containing the 299 - bp spacing repressed PBAD as well as a plasmid containing no insertion , but the insertion of an additional 4 bp at the Mlu I site in this plasmid significantly interfered with repression -LRB- Fig . 2b -RRB- . Plasmids with a 346 - bp separation and a 401 - bp separation between araI and araO2 poorly repressed and their repression was not significantly improved by inserting an additional 4 or 8 bp between araI and araO2 . This indicates that the loop size itself was the reason for the poor repression . The promoter activity on the plasmid with 616 bp between araI and araO2 2478 Biochemistry : Lee and Schleif Proc .

Repression as a function of loop size . -LRB- a -RRB- Qualitative test of 62 candidates containing insertions between araO2 and aral . The plasmids in strain DL100 were streaked on MacConkey galactoseindicating plates and the color of the colonies was recorded after 14 hr of growth . The solid line shows the best repression abilities in each size range . -LRB- b -RRB- Basal level araBAD promoter activities in strain DL100 by direct galactokinase assay of seven insertion plasmids and their derivatives that were chosen from the same 62 candidates shown in a . Broken lines indicate that subsequent basal level after addition of 4 or 8 bp at the Mlu I restriction site , isolation of repression - negative mutants after hydroxylamine mutagenesis of the araBAD promoter region -LRB- O - and I - -RRB- , or deletion of the araO2 site -LRB- A02 -RRB- - remained repression - negative even after insertion of an additional 4 or 8 bp . These results show that loops in the ara system larger than about 500 bp can not easily be formed with wild - type AraC protein . Mutations isolated solely on the basis that they reduced repression in the plasmid with the 299 - bp loop were located in the araI site -LRB- G A at position - 43 -RRB- and the araO2 site -LRB- C a T at position - 271 -RRB- or in the RNA polymerase binding site , just as was found by Martin et al . . This indicates that the araI and araO2 sites , and not extraneous sequences on the plasmid , were required for repression in this plasmid . Loop - Size Lower Limits . Deletions were generated to move araO2 and araI closer together , and the candidates retaining intact araO2 and CAP binding sites were further characterized . A deletion of 100 bp , leaving a loop of 111 bp , showed normal repression . It was a surprise that loops as small as this should form , since significant work is required to bend 100 bp of DNA into a circle . That is , the persistence length of DNA in physiological buffers is about 140 bp . Therefore , we tested whether the looping was between araI and araO2 by mutational analysis , as was done for the 299 - bp spacing plasmid , and found that the araI and araO2 sites in a plasmid containing the 146 - bp spacing were involved in a small repression loop . The smallest possible spacing between araI and araO2 that will not damage either site or the intervening CAP site is 70 bp . Deleting or damaging the CAP site substantially lowered the repressed and induced levels of PBAD -LRB- 1 , 30 -RRB- , and this would interfere with interpretation of data . In the absence of a functional CAP binding site , however , looping between araI and araO2 can be detected by its dramatic reduction of the arabinose - induced levels of PBAD activity when somewhat elevated levels of AraC protein are provided . To examine the ability to form small loops , we constructed another AraC - overproducing plasmid , pDL5 , which is compatible with the spacing mutant plasmids so that both the hypersynthesis plasmid and the PBAD - laCZ plasmid could be stably maintained in cells . The inducibility of PBAD in this system as a function of the araI - araO2 spacing was compared to the repression abilities in the CAP ' plasmids with the same spacings . As shown in Fig . 3c , both inducibility in the CAPsystem and repression in the CAP ' system show identical loop size dependencies for loops around 140 bp and loops around 230 bp . That is , the maxima and minima of the basal levels occur at the same loop sizes as the maxima and minima of the induced levels . Therefore , we extended our examination of loop formation to spacings of less than 70 bp between aral and araO2 when part or all of the CAP site was deleted . The inducibility of PBAD in the plasmids with the CAP site deleted oscillated as the spacing between aral and araO2 varied as shown in Fig . 3c . This oscillation retained the same periodicity of about 11 bp and the same phase as the oscillations in the basal level observed with the plasmids 4 aw 3 * - 2 ' a E < 1 0 9 10 11 12 13 Periodicity , bp -LRB- 0 E 2 0 a . 600 ' 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 Loop Size , bp b I : 1 E a . -LRB- 10 C . 6000 3000 0 I I I I II11I I 1 1 1 I I I C l ... w ~ ~ .

Even the small - spacing candidates with separations between araO2 and aral of 34 , 33 , and 32 bp , which leave just the two AraC protein binding sites intact , remained repression - positive . Thus there is no lower limit to the araO2 - araI loops . We also examined araO2 involvement in forming these small loops . First , an araO2 point mutant -LRB- G - * A at position - 271 -RRB- was constructed and its effect on expression was tested in a 44 - bp spacing plasmid . This mutation reduced repression by a factor of 2 , showing that araO2 is involved in the loop . We used occupancy of araO2 as a second measure of loop formation in the small - loop plasmids . The affinity of araO2 for AraC protein is insufficient for it to be occupied by AraC protein on its own . However , this site is occupied when it can loop to araf or araO1 . In vivo footprinting of araO2 showed it was unoccupied in the repression - minus plasmids with spacings of 38 and 49 bp but was occupied in the repression - positive plasmids with spacings of 33 and 44 bp , consistent with formation of the postulated small loops -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . Periodicity . Oscillations in repression ability as a function of spacing extend to about 400 - bp loops . The hashmarks in Fig . 3 b and c , which are spaced 11.1 bp apart remain in phase with the oscillations for loops 40 - 240 bp long , implying that the helical repeat of the DNA in vivo between araI and araO2 is 11.1 bp per turn . Fourier transformation of the same 95 points -LRB- Fig . 3a -RRB- objectively shows the same result . Periodicity and Linking Number Deficit . The linking number deficit of E . coli DNA could tend to untwist the DNA . Therefore , we tested whether a reduction in DNA gyrase activity would alter the apparent helical repeat in the ara system . Twelve plasmids with 222 - to 246 - bp spacings between araI and araO2 were transferred to strain DL110 , which is deficient in gyrase activity . In experiments not shown , topoisomer analysis on chloroquine - containing gels of plasmid DNA extracted from these cells showed it to contain about half the linking number deficit as plasmid DNA extracted from the strain used in the previous experiments . The change in the apparent helical repeat in the ara system , however , was barely detectable , if present at all , perhaps 2 - 4 bp in the loop tested . Not having remeasured the entire set of spacing plasmids in the gyrase mutant strain , we can not tell whether the nearest peak shifted 2 - 4 bp or some more distant peak shifted . To determine whether a more distant peak shifted by more than one cycle , we examined the apparent shift in loops of about half the size . We found a shift of at most 1 or 2 bp : > 0 -RRB- E C - 400 Biochemistry : Lee and Schleif 200 0 220 228 236 244 Loop Size , bp FIG . 4 .

Approximate shapes of looped DNA and the relative work required for the loop formation . in a series of 11 plasmids with 121 - to 148 - bp loops , strongly suggesting that the shift in helical repeat in the gyrase mutant was no larger than 2 bp per 100 bp of loop . Richardson et al . analyzed changes in the helical repeat that were generated by varying the linking number deficit in vitro . They found a repeat of 11.07 for of = - 0.061 and a repeat of 10.95 for o - = - 0.031 very similar to our in vivo finding . Energetics of Loop Formation . The fact that very small loops can form when araO2 and araf are correctly oriented suggests that AraC protein must bend significantly in the formation of these loops . Clearly , the actual looping process is aided by the supercoiling present in vivo -LRB- 2 , 31 , 32 -RRB- , and the results of calculations of the energies depend on the physical model chosen for looping . Nonetheless , as a crude approximation , we determined the approximate relative work necessary to form loops of various sizes if the protein had a fixed diameter but was highly flexible . As the loop size decreased , the work required for loop formation first increased , then declined . The decline was obtained when the protein bent appreciably to form the loop , ultimately reaching a region of somewhat dubious physical significance . We can not easily estimate the propensity to loop as a function of loop size from these considerations , since K = exp -LRB- - AG / R7 -RRB- and AG = AH - TAS . We have estimated relative changes in H but can not estimate AS for loop formation . DISCUSSION The L - arabinose operon of E . coli has long been known to be positively and negatively regulated by AraC . Binding AraC protein at araI and at araO2 , sites separated by 211 bp , and association of these two proteins to form a DNA loop is necessary for the negative regulation or repression of the araBAD promoter PBAD -LRB- 1 - 4 -RRB- . As DNA looping appears to be a wide - spread and versatile mechanism utilized in gene regulation , we have explored the parameters of looping in the ara system . We found that separating araI and araO2 by more than about 500 bp eliminated detectable repression . At the other extreme , no lower limit to their spacing was found , implying that AraC protein possesses significant flexibility . As the spacing between araO2 and araI varies , the level of expression of PBAD oscillates with a period of about 11.1 bp , suggesting that in vivo the DNA between araI and araO2 possesses a helical repeat of about 11.1 bp per turn . We are surprised at the relatively small upper limit to the ara loop size . In the deo system a small amount of looping is detectable when the relevant operator sites are separated by as much as 5000 bp . Similarly , the enhancers of eukary - 480 Biochemistry : Lee and Schleif otic genes likely utilize DNA looping and they often function from distances exceeding 500 bp . Certainly , however , as the distance separating araI and araO2 increases , looping must become more difficult because of the lowered concentration of one site in the presence of the other - i . e . , for entropic reasons . As a first approximation to estimating distance effects on looping , we might estimate the concentration of araO2 in the presence of araI by assuming the intervening DNA was a long polymer with random angles between stiff segments . This is equivalent to a three - dimensional random walk , and yields concentration as a function of the distance f between the sites varying as U - 3 ! 2 . If the loop size is increased from 300 to 500 bp , this relationship predicts a decrease in concentration of one site in the presence of the other by 54 % . This result is at significant variance with the data presented in Fig . 2 in which the effective concentration must change by much more so that the repression changes from full to undetectable over this range . Presumably the estimation is poor because of the unknown orientation and position requirements of aral and araO2 for looping in addition to the unknown effects of DNA supercoiling and binding by other proteins . Our experimental result that there is no lower size limit for the ara loop suggests that AraC protein is flexible . This would have to be a particular flexibility however . On one hand the protein appears free to bend parallel to the DNA . On the other hand , the fact that misorienting araI and araO2 interferes with repression implies that the protein is not significantly free to bend in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the DNA . If we assume the protein is completely free to bend in the direction required to form small loops and that it holds the araI and araO2 sites a fixed distance apart , we can approximately determine the loop shape and the relative work required for formation . As we have discussed , larger loops , while energetically more easily formed , are less favored for entropic reasons . One interesting outcome of the looping energetics calculations is the apparently greater work required to form a loop of about 100 bp . This maximum may correspond to the relatively poor repression seen for loops of 140 - 160 bp -LRB- Fig . 3b -RRB- . Our finding of the 11.1 - bp periodicity of ara PBAD repression raises the question of the structure of DNA in vivo . A number of experiments have shown that the helical repeat of linear DNA in vitro is about 10.5 bp per turn -LRB- 6 - 8 -RRB- . Special sequences can give rise to different helical repeats - e . g . , 10.0 ± 0.1 bp per turn with poly -LRB- dA -RRB- - poly -LRB- dT -RRB- and 13.6 bp per turn with poly -LRB- dG - dC -RRB- - poly -LRB- dG - dC -RRB- -LRB- 37 , 38 -RRB- , but sequence analysis of the ara PBAD regulatory region reveals no special base distributions or sequence features with periodicities of 10 - 12 bp . Additionally , the independence of the oscillation cycle with various sizes of spacing and with various combinations of sequences by random deletions and insertions nearly excludes the possibility that the sequence alone of the ara regulatory region is responsible for the 11.1 - bp periodicity we observed . We suspect that the linking number deficit of E . coli DNA shifts the average helical repeat from its relaxed value of 10.5 bp per turn to around 11.1 . A linking number deficit can generate a torsion that generates supercoiling . This same torsion is in a direction that it could also act to unwind the DNA . In fact , the apparent supercoiling density in vivo measured on a plasmid was appreciably less than its probable linking number deficit . If the remainder of the linking number deficit were applied to untwisting the DNA , the helical repeat could approach 11 bp per turn . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci .

During anaerobic growth in minimal medium -LRB- i . e . , when no formate was added to the growth vessel -RRB- , the steady - state level of formate produced by wild - type E . coli was 3.2 mM . 
The price for this , however , could be an increased likelihood of palindrome formation leading to severely negative effects on the overall levels of gene expression . 
For this reason , all subsequent data -LRB- Fig . 3 to 7 -RRB- relate to samples taken during the mid - logarithmic to late logarithmic phase .

Figure 6 shows that the induction kinetics as well as the basal and induced levels of isomerase are identical in the AraJ ' -LRB- CW2549 -RRB- and the AraP - -LRB- TRAJ7 strains at all of the arabinose concentrations tested . Hence , araJ is not involved in arabinose regulation under the conditions used for this assay . This leaves araJ a gene without an obvious function . It is unlikely that aIraJ is involved in chemotaxis since E . -LRB- oli does not detectably respond to arabinose by chemotaxis . Neither is it likely that araJ is involved in arabinose catabolism - , there is no evidence that a catabolic pathway other than the known one exists in E . -LRB- oli . Perhaps the most attractive hypothesis for aral function is that it is involved in either the transport or processing of arabinose polymers , which are widespread in nature . The probable signal peptide on AraJ is consistent with this hypothesis , since both transport -LRB- outer membrane -RRB- or processing -LRB- periplasmic space -RRB- would require passage of AraJ across the inner membrane .

The presumed helix - turn - helix motif is underlined . narQ strain exhibited uninducible ' t -LRB- aeg - 46.5 - lacZ -RRB- expression . By contrast , in the presence of nitrite , the narX and narQ strains were equally uninducible . We have considered a variety of explanations for these observations but prefer to reserve interpretation until we better understand the roles of the NarP and NarL proteins in this control . Finally , we examined the effects of an fnr null allele on ' F -LRB- aeg - 46.5 - lacZ -RRB- expression in narL and narP strains . Expression was very low irrespective of nar genotype -LRB- data not shown -RRB- , showing that the fnr mutation is epistatic to narL and narP mutations , as expected . The FD -LRB- aeg - 46.5 - lacZ -RRB- operon fusion results from an insertion in the aeg - 46.5 operon , thus disrupting the function of its encoded product -LRB- s -RRB- . This could potentially affect the observed pattern of regulation , if , for example , the aeg - 46.5 operon product -LRB- s -RRB- plays an essential metabolic role in anaerobiosis . However , we monitored nitrate reductase synthesis and nitrite production or consumption in aeg - 46.5 cultures , and both aspects were indistinguishable from those of the wild - type in both nitrate - and nitrite - grown cultures -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . Regulation offdnG operon expression . We next examined the effects of nar regulatory genes on F -LRB- fdnG - lacZ -RRB- expression . Previous work from our laboratory has shown that the fdnG operon is induced approximately 100 - fold by growth with nitrate and that either narX + or narQ + is sufficient for normal induction . In addition , approximately fourfold induction by nitrate remains in narL null strains , but this low - level induction is abolished in narX narQ double - null strains . Finally , the fdnG operon is weakly induced during growth with nitrite -LRB- 2 , 29 -RRB- . Wild - type and narP null strains exhibited similar patterns of 4 -LRB- fdnG - IacZ -RRB- expression , namely , strong induction by nitrate and weak induction by nitrite . The narL null strain exhibited weak nitrate and nitrite induction . However , the narL narP double - null strain , like the narX narQ strain , was devoid of -LRB- D -LRB- fdnG - lacZ -RRB- induction by either nitrate or nitrite . This shows that the NarP protein is responsible for the residual induction observed in narL null strains . We do not know how or where the NarP protein acts in controllingfdnG operon expression . In narL + strains , irrespective of narP genotype , introduction of a narQ null allele had only a small effect on nitrate and nitrite induction of 4 ' -LRB- fdnG - lacZ -RRB- expression , as expected from previous observations . However , the situation was quite different in the narX null derivatives , where nitrite induction was elevated to nearly the same levels as nitrate induction in the wild type . This is a very striking result , for it provides a clear - cut regulatory phenotype for a narX null narQ + strain -LRB- 14 , 29 -RRB- . We have argued previously that the NarX protein plays a negative role in NarL - mediated gene expression -LRB- 8 , 15 -RRB- . This observation provides clear evidence for a negative function of the NarX protein : eliminating NarX -LRB- but not NarQ -RRB- by mutation caused significant NarL - dependent induction of gene expression in the presence of nitrite . An interpretation of this result , that nitrite is an efficient -LRB- ? -LRB- fdnG - lacZ -RRB- inducer in a narX null strain , is that the . 4 -LRB- aeg - 46.5 - lacZ -RRB- expression in nar regulatory mutants , B - Galactosidase sp act ' Genotypea narL + narP + narL narP + narL + narP narL narP Nonec + NO3 - c + NO2 c None + NO3 + NO2 None + NO3 - + NO2 - None + NO3 - + NO2 - narX + narQ + 51 130 520 300 1,540 1,360 25 19 24 25 27 18 narX narQ + 26 140 47 400 1,630 1,420 27 20 18 23 25 18 narX + narQ 35 28 43 360 1,100 920 25 20 25 24 28 19 narX narQ 25 31 19 26 31 21 22 24 17 26 27 20 a Combination of narL , narP , narX , and narQ wild - type or null alleles as indicated . b - Galactosidase specific activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods and is expressed in Miller units . cAnaerobic growth with no acceptor -LRB- None -RRB- , with nitrate -LRB- + NO3 - -RRB- , or with nitrite -LRB- + NO2 -RRB- as indicated . 3264 RABIN AND STEWART J .

Thus , in the wild type , much of the NarL - phosphate formed by the NarQ protein in response to nitrite would be dephosphorylated by the NarX protein . In the mutant lacking the NarX protein , NarL - phosphate would accumulate , leading to substantial 1 ' -LRB- fdnG - lacZ -RRB- induction . In the narL null strain , nitrate and nitrite induction were consistently higher in the narX than in the narQ derivative . This mirrors our observations with J -RRB- -LRB- aeg - 46 . 5 - lacZ -RRB- expression , where the narQ strain was slightly defective in nitrate induction in the narL null background . Taken together , these observations suggest that the NarQ protein phosphorylates the NarP protein to a somewhat higher level than does the NarX protein , although the differences are rather subtle . Regulation of narG operon expression . Expression of the narG operon is induced approximately 100 - fold by nitrate , and this induction is abolished by narL null alleles . Either the NarX or NarQ protein is sufficient for normal regulation . narG operon expression is also induced by nitrite . A narP null allele had no effect on nitrate or nitrite induction of ' 1 -LRB- narG - lacZ -RRB- expression . Conversely , a narL null allele abolished both nitrate and nitrite induction , irrespective of the presence of narP + . Thus , the narP gene has no effect on F -LRB- narG - lacZ -RRB- expression . In a narX null mutant , nitrite was as effective as nitrate in inducing I ? -LRB- narG - lacZ -RRB- expression , as observed also with -LRB- ? -LRB- fdnG - lacZ -RRB- expression -LRB- compare Tables 3 and 4 -RRB- . Conversely , nitrite induction of cF -LRB- narG - lacZ -RRB- expression in the narQ null strain was less efficient than in the wild type -LRB- compare Tables 3 and 4 -RRB- . As described above , we believe that these observations reflect a negative regulatory role for the narX + gene in nitrite regulation . Regulation of frd4 operon expression . Expression of the frdA operon is repressed approximately 10 - fold by nitrate , and this repression is abolished by narL null alleles -LRB- 17 , 40 -RRB- . Either the NarX or NarQ protein is sufficient for full repression -LRB- 5 , 29 -RRB- , while repression is abolished in a narX narQ double - null strain . F -LRB- frdA - lacZ -RRB- expression was slightly stimulated by nitrite . Again , a narP null allele had no effect on -LRB- I -LRB- frdA - lacZ -RRB- expression , while a narL null allele abolished nitrate repression irrespective of the presence of narP + . Thus , the narP gene had no effect on F -LRB- frdA - lacZ -RRB- expression . Nitrite was an effective repressor of F -LRB- frdA - lacZ -RRB- expression in a narX null mutant , while it was without effect in a narQ null strain and in the narX narQ double - null strain . Again , we believe that nitrite repression in the narX null strain reflects a negative regulatory role for the NarX protein . Hierarchy of NarL - mediated regulation . Several observations have led us to believe that expression of the narG , fdnG , and frdA operons is differentially sensitive to NarLmediated regulation . First , narX insertion alleles , which reduce -LRB- but do not eliminate -RRB- narL gene expression through polarity , cause only a slight decrease in nitrate induction of narG operon induction while virtually eliminating nitrate repression offrdA operon expression -LRB- 14 , 41 -RRB- . Nitrate induction of fdnG operon expression in such strains is decreased by a greater extent than is narG expression , but it is not eliminated . These observations suggest a hierarchy of narG > fdnG > frdA with respect to the threshold of NarL - phosphate necessary for regulation . Other observations with missense constitutive alleles of narL and narX support this hierarchy : in each case , the constitutive allele causes relatively high - level expression of 1D -LRB- narGlacZ -RRB- , intermediate expression of FD -LRB- fdnG - lacZ -RRB- , and little or no repression of 4 ? -LRB- frdA - lacZ -RRB- . . 4 -LRB- narG - lacZ -RRB- expression in nar regulatory mutants 13 - Galactosidase sp act ' Genotypea narL + narP + narL narP + narL + narP narL narP Nonec + NO3 '' C + NO2 '' C None + NO3 - + NO2 - None + NO3 - + NO2 - None + NO3 - + NO2 - narX + narQ + 33 3,100 380 30 23 25 32 2,860 280 25 28 31 narX narQ + 57 2,880 3,320 29 21 23 _ _ d narX + narQ 30 2,950 140 narX narQ 29 29 34 a Combination of narL , narP , narX , and narQ wild - type or null alleles as indicated . b 13 - Galactosidase specific activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods and is expressed in Miller units . c Anaerobic growth with no acceptor -LRB- None -RRB- , with nitrate -LRB- + NO3 - -RRB- , or with nitrite -LRB- + NO2 - -RRB- as indicated . d _ , not determined .

The patterns of nitrite induction in wild - type strains provide further support for this hierarchy -LRB- compare Tables 3 , 4 , and 5 -RRB- . Nitrite induction of ' I -LRB- narG - lacZ -RRB- expression was greater than that of 41 -LRB- fdnG - lacZ -RRB- expression , while ' F -LRB- frdAlacZ -RRB- expression was essentially indifferent to nitrite . Taken together with the above - described results , this reflects , in our opinion , differential sensitivities of the various control regions to the amount of NarL - phosphate . Relatively low levels of NarL - phosphate seem to be sufficient for substantial narG operon induction , while relatively high levels of NarL - phosphate seem to be required forfrdA operon repression . If the NarX protein is predominantly -LRB- but not exclusively -RRB- a NarL - phosphate phosphatase in the presence of nitrite , then relatively little NarL - phosphate would accumulate in wild - type cells grown with nitrite . This low level of NarL - phosphate would be sufficient for relatively strong ' ? -LRB- narG - lacZ -RRB- expression but insufficient for observable D -LRB- frdA - lacZ -RRB- repression . The arrangement of NarL protein - binding sites in the narG and fdnG operon control regions is quite different -LRB- 13 , 22 -RRB- , and the control regions also differ in their requirement for an accessory factor , integration host factor . Thus , the differential sensitivities of these two control regions for NarL - phosphate could reflect different binding - site affinities or different mechanisms of transcription activation . Likewise , the levels of NarL - phosphate necessary to repress frdA operon expression depend on binding affinity and mode of action . Therefore , the mechanistic bases for this hierarchy of sensitivity to NarL - mediated regulation are currently unknown . Regulation of aeg - 93 -LRB- nri -RRB- operon expression . Expression of ' F -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- is induced by nitrate in a narL null strain . This regulation , which is analogous to but distinct from that of the aeg - 46.5 operon , also suggested the existence of a nitrate - responsive transcription factor in addition to the NarL protein . Thus , we examined 4 -RRB- -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression in response to nitrate and nitrite in the various nar regulatory gene mutants . In narL + strains , FD -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression was efficiently induced by nitrite but not nitrate irrespective of the narP gene . By contrast , F -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression in the narP + narL null strain was induced equally well by either nitrate or nitrite . This shows that the NarL protein represses ' I -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression in response to nitrate but activates expression in response to nitrite . The NarP protein , by contrast , mediates activation by both nitrate and nitrite . In the narL null narP + strain , either narX + or narQ + was sufficient for full induction by either nitrate or nitrite , demonstrating again that either the NarX or NarQ protein can activate the NarP protein in response to either nitrate or nitrite . In the absence of nitrate and nitrite , F -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression was elevated in the narQ narL null strain . This implies that the NarQ protein negatively regulates the NarP protein , much like the NarX protein negatively regulates the NarL protein . However , basal expression of 4D -LRB- aeg - 46.5 - lacZ -RRB- was not elevated in the narQ narL strain . Regulation by nitrate and nitrite followed essentially identical patterns in narL + strains , irrespective of the presence of the narP gene . This shows that NarL - mediated repression is phenotypically dominant to NarP - mediated activation . That the same regulatory pattern was observed in both narL + narP + and narL + narP null strains implies that induction of ' F -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression in narL + strains reflects NarL - mediated activation . Although more complicated hypotheses are not excluded , this is the simplest one that explains currently available data . In narL + strains , nitrate prevented eD -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression equally well in narX and in narQ null strains , .

This suggests that high levels of NarL - phosphate act to repress ' F -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression , irrespective of the presence of NarPphosphate . The pattern of regulation by nitrite was quite different . In narX + strains , nitrite was an effective inducer of NarLmediated F -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression . By contrast , in the narX null narQ + strain , nitrite had little effect on NarLmediated ' I -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression . We have argued above that narX + strains have relatively low levels of NarLphosphate when cultured in the presence of nitrite , while narX null narQ + strains accumulate relatively high levels of NarL - phosphate . Thus , the data for the single - sensor mutants suggest that NarL - mediated induction of CF -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression occurs only when NarL - phosphate levels are relatively low -LRB- nitrite - grown narX + cultures -RRB- . When NarL - phosphate levels are relatively high -LRB- nitrate - grown cultures and nitrite - grown narX null narQ + cultures -RRB- , F -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- is not expressed . This hypothesis seemingly presents a paradox . We concluded above that higher levels of NarL - phosphate result in more efficient induction of fdnG operon expression , for example , but here we argue that lower levels of NarLphosphate result in more efficient induction of aeg - 93 -LRB- nrf -RRB- operon expression . Can these ideas be reconciled ? A difference in these models is that high levels of NarL - phosphate are postulated to repress aeg - 93 -LRB- ntf -RRB- operon expression , while the NarL protein does not repress fdnG operon expression under any conditions . Thus , NarL - phosphate plays a dual role at the aeg - 93 -LRB- ntf -RRB- control region . An explanation for this dichotomy follows the model for OmpR - mediated regulation of the ompF gene -LRB- 31 , 33 , 34 -RRB- . Silhavy and students have interpreted their genetic analyses to reveal ompF gene activation when OmpR - phosphate levels are relatively low and ompF gene repression when OmpR - phosphate levels are relatively high . The key to this model is that repression -LRB- by high levels of OmpR - phosphate -RRB- is phenotypically dominant to activation -LRB- by low levels of OmpR - phosphate -RRB- . Our own genetic analysis of aeg - 93 -LRB- nrf -RRB- regulation is much less advanced than that for the ompF gene , but this type of model provides an attractive working hypothesis to guide future experimentation . Residual nitrate and nitrite induction of ' F -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression remained in narL narP double - null , narX narQ double - null , and all combinations of triple - null strains . In fact , some induction remained even in the quadruplenull mutant . This implies that yet a third nitrate - and nitrite - responsive regulatory system is involved in regulating aeg - 93 -LRB- nrf -RRB- operon expression . Elucidation of this system remains a challenge for future work . Finally , we examined the effects of an fnr null allele on ' t -LRB- aeg - 93 - lacZ -RRB- expression in narL and narP strains . Expression was very low irrespective of nar genotype -LRB- data not shown -RRB- , showing that the fnr mutation is epistatic to narL and narP mutations , as expected . The growth physiology of the aeg - 93 -LRB- nrf -RRB- insertion strain was tested in parallel with that of the aeg - 46.5 strain -LRB- see above -RRB- , and again no difference from that of the wild type was observed -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . Hypothesis . The interplay between two response regulators , two sensors , two regulatory metabolites , and five target operons inevitably means that complex and diverse regulatory interactions are involved in different contexts .

This hypothesis , depicted schematically in Fig . 4 , will help to guide future work aimed at understanding nitrate and nitrite control of anaerobic respiratory gene expression . For reference , summarizes the observed regulatory patterns . First , consider NarL - mediated regulation . In the presence of nitrate , either the NarX or NarQ protein is sufficient to form high levels of NarL - phosphate . This amount of NarLphosphate fully activates narG and fdnG operon expression and fully represses frdA , aeg - 46.5 , and aeg - 93 -LRB- nt - -RRB- operon expression . The NarX protein also negatively regulates the NarL protein by acting as a NarL - phosphate phosphatase in the absence of nitrate . The NarQ protein apparently does not have a similar negative role -LRB- 29 ; and this work -RRB- . In the presence of nitrite , the NarQ protein acts to phosphorylate NarL with an efficiency approaching that seen in nitrate - grown cultures . However , the NarX protein acts predominantly as a NarL - phosphate phosphatase , although some NarL kinase activity is also present . The net effect is that only intermediate levels of NarL - phosphate accumulate in wild - type nitrite - grown cells . This intermediate level of NarL - phosphate activates the narG operon relatively efficiently , activates the fdnG operon and represses the aeg - 46.5 operon relatively weakly , and has no effect on expression of the frdA operon . This intermediate level of NarL - phosphate is insufficient to repress expression of the aeg - 93 -LRB- nrf -RRB- operon and instead actually activates its expression . Second , consider NarP - mediated regulation . The NarP protein apparently has no effect on narG or frdA operon expression . In the presence of nitrate or nitrite , the NarP protein is phosphorylated by either NarQ or NarX to ap - VOL . 175 , 1993 NarP , A SECOND NITRATE RESPONSE REGULATOR 3267 .

NarP - phosphate weakly activates fdnG operon expression and efficiently activates aeg - 46.5 and aeg - 93 -LRB- nrf -RRB- operon expression . However , the final level of aeg operon expression is set by competition between NarP - mediated activation and the efficiency of NarL - mediated repression . A potential complication for any comprehensive hypothesis is the fact that one regulatory metabolite , nitrite , is formed by metabolism of the other regulatory metabolite , nitrate . Our cultures are grown with excess nitrate , which thus persists in the culture medium well past the time of culture harvest . Nonetheless , nitrate - grown cultures steadily accumulate nitrite during the course of growth . This nitrite accumulation could influence some of the regulatory pathways depicted in Fig . 4 . Further analysis will attempt to clearly separate the effects of nitrate , nitrite , and nitrate plus nitrate . However , enterobacteria growing in the wild probably encounter nitrate and nitrite in various concentrations and proportions , so the results with nitrate - grown batch cultures probably reflect a reasonable approximation of normal regulation .

In every case , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- bound as well as or more tightly -LRB- i . e . , had a lower K D -LSB- equilibrium dissociation constant -RRB- than WT MarA . For several promoter marboxes this change was dramatic : the K D dropped from > > 150 to 50 for inaA , from 200 to 75 for nfsB , and from > > 150 nM to ~ 100 nM for both ybjC and yhbW . In spite of this , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- activation was greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjC ; it was comparable to that of WT MarA for micF and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdaB , nfsB , and ybhW -LRB- and Fig . 1 -RRB- . We conclude that the WT glutamic acid of MarA at position 89 is an inhibitor of MarA binding to many marboxes . In an effort to understand why E89 is inhibitory , we examined the sequences of the 14 marboxes for which we have data . We noticed that five haveaTatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequences is increased by the E89A substitution -LRB- less than 1.7 - fold -RRB- . In contrast , of the remaining nine sequences that do not have aTatthis position , the binding of E89A was increased for six of them by > 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increased binding . Although the cocrystal structure of MarA with the marRAB marbox DNA -LRB- with aTatposition 12 -RRB- indicates no interaction between the two molecules at this position , we considered the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox DNA and MarA could limit activation by MarA when position 12 is not a T residue -LRB- see the Discussion for a fuller treatment -RRB- . To examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with marbox DNAs lacking aTatposition 12 , we tested the effects of several amino acid substitutions at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacZ fusion and the mdtG : : lacZ fusion , the two fusions that showed the greatest effects of E89A on activation -LRB- see above -RRB- . Plasmids carrying WT MarA , the MarA variant MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- -LRB- with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89G -RRB- -LRB- with no side chain -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89D -RRB- -LRB- with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid -RRB- , MarA -LRB- E89V -RRB- -LRB- with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of SoxS and having a dimethyl methylene side chain , -RRB- , WT SoxS , and SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- were introduced into these fusions and assayed for β - galactosidase . Again , activation of these promoters by SoxS was much greater than that by MarA . Similarly , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- was considerably more active than WT MarA . In contrast , the E89D variant was less active than WT MarA for fpr and completely inactive -LRB- indistinguishable from the control plasmid -RRB- for mdtG . E89G was approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtG although for both promoters it was considerably less active than E89A . The E89V variant was marginally more active than the WT for both promoters but substantially less so than E89A . SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- reduced the activation of these promoters relative to WT SoxS , but SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- was still more active than WT MarA . -LRB- The activations shown here are greater than those apparent in because the expression of the plasmids carrying MarA , SoxS , and their mutants is not entirely shut off by lacI q so that the increases expressed in appear smaller . -RRB- As outlined in the Discussion , these results , namely , -LRB- i -RRB- that variant E89D is virtually inactive , -LRB- ii -RRB- that E89G is very active although to a lesser extent than E89A , -LRB- iii -RRB- that E89V is only marginally more active than the WT , and -LRB- iv -RRB- that SoxS -LRB- V83E -RRB- has reduced activation although not to the low levels expressed by WT MarA , are consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of E89 sterically inhibits interaction with the DNA for marbox sequences lacking aTat position 12 . If , as outlined above and presented in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between positions 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 is responsible for the very poor activation of promoters such as fpr , then it would be predicted that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhanced if that phosphate were absent . We therefore compared the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - stranded DNA containing the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsDNA of the same sequence and length but prepared so that the phosphate linkage between positions 12 and 13 of the marbox was eliminated -LRB- see Materials and Methods -RRB- . Again -LRB- Fig . 2 and -RRB- , MarA bound very poorly to the fpr marbox . However , binding increased significantly when the fpr DNA lacked the phosphate group between positions 12 and 13 -LRB- Fig . 4A and B -RRB- . In contrast , SoxS bound more tightly to dsDNA than to the discontinuous DNA -LRB- Fig . 4B -RRB- . When the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream -LRB- between positions 9 and 10 -RRB- was absent , no significant alteration in binding was observed although a small increase was observed when the phosphate between positions 15 and 16 was absent . We conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibits the ability of MarA to bind . Activation and marbox binding by MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- . The only other MarA mutation found here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class I promoters was Q91A . Of the seven class I promoters examined , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- activated the acrAB , marRAB , and zwf promoters to similar extents as WT MarA but activated acnA , fpr , mdtG , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT levels -LRB- ; see also below -RRB- . For the nine class II promoters , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- significantly reduced the activation of fumC , inaA , micF , pqiA , and ybjC but had no significant effect on nfsB , mdaB , sodA , oryhbW . MarA - -LRB- Q91 -RRB- has been identified as forming van der Waals interactions with the methyl groups of the two thymidines that are complementary to the adenines at positions 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence . Thus , it would be expected that the Q91A substitution might reduce activation of the seven class II promoters that have at least one A at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoters , nfsB and sodA , that have no A residues at these positions . Indeed , nfsB and sodA are among the promoters that Q91A activated to the same extent as WT MarA . Since Q91A reduced the expression of four of the seven class I promoters and four of the nine class II promoters , our results are inconsistent with the proposition that Q91 is principally required for interactions at class II promoters , as has been proposed for the analogous site -LRB- Q85 -RRB- in SoxS . For the majority of these promoters , the gel mobility assay for binding of MarA to marboxes was insufficiently precise to determine whether there is a correlation between binding and activation by MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- relative to MarA . Among the class I promoters that exhibited measurable binding to MarA , MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- showed no greater binding or activation for acrAB , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtG and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marRAB . A modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation was seen for the class II mdaB promoter . Although not observed in these experiments , a more detailed analysis of the binding of MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- to the micF marbox -LRB- using protein without the His 6 tag -RRB- showed a very small reduction in binding concomitant with the reduced ability of MarA -LRB- Q91A -RRB- to activate the class II micF promoter . Thus , relative to MarA , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for Q91A at class I promoters , but none is obvious with regard to the class II promoters . Activation of superoxide resistance by MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- . If the glutamic acid at position 89 of MarA is a major determinant in vivo of the reduced activity of MarA at many promoters where SoxS is more active , we would expect cells carrying MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- to be more resistant to superoxides than cells carrying WT MarA . This was tested with gradient plate assays of sensitivity to two superoxide - generating compounds , phenazine methosulfate -LRB- PMS -RRB- and menadione . Cells constitutively expressing MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- were more resistant than WT MarA to PMS -LRB- 1.7 - fold -RRB- and , to a lesser extent , to menadione -LRB- 1.3 - fold -RRB- . Comparable MICs with SoxS for PMS were 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . Clearly , MarA -LRB- E89A -RRB- activates superoxide resistance to a greater extent than WT MarA . Curiously , the Q91A substitution had no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator PMS -LRB- MIC of 35 μM for both the Q91A mutant and the WT MarA -RRB- but lowered resistance to the superoxide generator menadione -LRB- MIC of 0.9 mM for the Q91A mutant and 1.8 mM for the WT -RRB- . DISCUSSION . The MarA - SoxS - Rob regulon of E . coli consists of a variety of genes that enable cells to adapt to multiple stresses . It contains genes that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant -LRB- acrAB , tolC , and micF -RRB- and that defend against superoxide stress -LRB- e . g . , acnA , fpr , fumC , nfsA , sodA , and zwf -RRB- -LRB- 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 -RRB- . Not surprisingly , there are quantitative differences in the extents of activation of particular promoters by the paralogous activators so that the phenotypic outcomes depend on which activator is upregulated -LRB- 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 -RRB- . E89 inhibition . We have shown here that the MarA glutamic acid residue E89 is responsible for decreasing the binding of WT MarA relative to SoxS for the class I marbox promoters , acnA , mdtG , fpr , and zwf , thereby decreasing the relative activation of these promoters and hence the resistance engendered to superoxides by MarA . We think the following may explain these results . A detail of the MarA structure shows that E89 is oriented in the cocrystal with its acidic groups exposed to the solvent away from the DNA backbone . In so doing , methyl hydrogens on the β - and - carbons are positioned restrictively close to an oxygen of the phosphate group between bases T12 and G13 of the marRAB marbox . Even this orientation of E89 is only possible as the result of a small `` clash '' -LRB- as predicted by the MolProbity program -LSB- http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / -RSB- -RRB- between E89 and S90 that permits the rotation of E89 into the MarA core and away from the DNA backbone .
