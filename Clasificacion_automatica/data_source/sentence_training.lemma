Page et be show that disruption of narl lead to decrease expression from pnirb . to recheck the possible involvement of narl factor , expression from pnirb and pnirba57 be measure in strain jcb3883 . which be a narl derivative of jcb387 , datum in fig . 2 confirm that the effect of the narl mutation be to decrease expression from pnirb in all condition . with pnirba57 , the sharp repression of activity by nitrate be relieve by disruption of narl . as a control for these experiment we also measure the effect of disrupt narl on expression from a semisynthetic fnr - dependent promoter in which the nirB fnr - bind site be ' transplant ' into the e . coli meir promoter . expression from this promoter -lrb- f2pmelr d25x , describe in fig . 5 of Bell et be , 1990 -rrb- be induce anaerobically but be not stimulate further by nitrite or nitrate and be unaffected by narl mutation -lrb- not show -rrb- . thus , the simplest explanation for the result in fig . 2 be that narl protein bind to a site upstream of - 57 and be , at least partially , responsible for nitrite and nitrate effect . misplace the narl - bind site by one base pair stop induction and lead to narl - dependent repression , presumably as the misplace narl interfere with fnr . mutagenesis of a putative narl - bind site scrutiny of the pnirb sequence from - 83 to - 57 reveal a imperfect inverted repeat from position - 79 to - 60 which could be a site for a dna - bind regulatory protein -lrb- fig , 1 -rrb- , the two 10 bp motif that make up this inverted repeat show similarity to element in a 27 bp sequence located around - 200 at the narg promoter , that Li and DeMoss show to be the narl - bind site . Figure 1 show that the narg sequence from - 207 to - 188 appear to be make up of a direct repeat of two similar 10 - base element , whilst the nirb promoter from - 79 to - 60 carry a inverted repeat of related sequence . to investigate the significance of the nirb inverted repeat we make a number of base - pair change use site - directed mutagenesis . in a first experiment we make a cg to g : c transversion at - 75 -lrb- p75g -rrb- , a g : c to c : g tranversion at - 64 -lcb- p64c -rrb- and the double mutation combine both change -lrb- p64c p75g -rrb- . the change be Illustrated in Fig . 1 : note that the two mutation be identical in the context of the inverted repeat , both be located at the fifth position of the 10 - base element . the result in show that the two single mutation produce similar effect : they both cause a decrease in anaerobic level of expression from pnirb , they abolish nitrite induction but have little effect on induction by nitrate . the effect of the single mutation be similar to the effect of disrupt narL however , combine together , the p75g and p64c mutation lead to a more severe decrease in pn / rsactivity in all condition and prevent induction by both nitrite and nitrate . we next create transversion at the sixth position of the 10 - base element by make the mutation p74g -lrb- c : g to g : c at - 74 -rrb- and p65c -lrb- a : t to c : g at - 65 -rrb- , the result in show that the effect of these single change be to decrease anaerobic induction both with and without nitrite , but , again , induction by nitrate be not suppress . however , when combine , the p74g and p65c mutation suppress pnirb expression in alt condition . the simplest interpretation of these result be that the nirb inverted repeat be recognize by two narl subunit . and that narl binding be need for optimal pnirb expression both during growth in anaerobic condition and during nitrite / nitrate induction . it be not clear why the p74g mutation have more severe effect than the p65c change . interestingly , in the context of the nirb inverted repeat , the base at position 6 of the 10 - base element be not symmetric . we find that the transition p65g and p74t have no effect on pnirb activity , suggest that the binding factor can tolerate a pyrimidine but not a purine at position 6 of the 10 - base element . effect of narl - binding - site mutation in a narl background although narl be originally characterize as a factor essential for nitrate - induction of gene expression , disruption of narl do not completely stop nitrate induction of pnirb -lrb- Page et be . 1990 , and fig , 2 -rrb- , it be possible that cell contain a second transcription factor respond to nitrate , though , unlike narl . this putative factor must be unable to respond to nitrite . we therefore investigate the effect of mutation at the fifth and sixth position of the inverted repeat element on pnirb expression in the absence of narl , the result in show that three of the four single mutation decrease narl - independent stimulation of pnirb expression by nitrate . we conclude that any second factor be likely to bind to sequence similar to narl , note that the single and double mutation also reduce the fnr - dependent pnirb expression during anaerobic growth in the absence of externally add nitrite or nitrate , suggest that both narl and the second factor be need for optimal anaerobically induce fnr - dependent transcription . a mutation in fnr that affect induction o / pnirB since expression from pnirb be dependent on fnr in all growth condition , it be possible that additional protein , responsible for nitrite and nitrate induction , exert they effect by interact with fnr . we therefore investigate the effect of known fnr mutation on nitrite and ' nitrate induction at pnirb . 154 k . l Tyson , A .

Rabin ef be , 1992 -rrb- . in contrast , at the nirb promoter , narl bind adjacent to fnr . fnr - independent expression be minimal , and the simplest explanation for the result be that narl interact with fnr : we suppose that the g85a change in fnr alter the conformation ol fnr to interfere with this interaction . current model of how fnr activate transcription -lrb- base mainly on in vitro study with the cyclic amp receptor protein , grp , a related activator -rrb- envisage that the dna wrap around the FNR , result in a contact between rna polymerase and sequence upstream of bind fnr -lrb- Busby , 1992 -rrb- . it be possible that narl , which also bind to this upstream region , be necessary to help ' set up ' this interaction . at semi - synthetic fnr - dependent promoter -lrb- such as f2pmelr d25x . see Bell et al . , 1990 -rrb- a fnr - site alone be sufficient for efficient fnr - dependent transcription activation . however , at pnirb , the promoter context appear to impose the necessity of a upstream factor for efficient fnr activity . there be a156 k . l Tyson , A .

Withey and r . f . s . , unpublished work -rrb- that arabinose do not affect dimerization of arac monomer , the effect of arabinose on the binding of aracdimcl - lexadna to the lexa operator most likely be the result of a conformational change in the n - terminal part of the protein . a similar trans - domain ligand - induced response have be observe in fusion protein carry the lexa dnabinding domain and the hormone - bind site of the glucocorticoid receptor . Proc . Natl . Acad Sci . USA 90 in summary , functional chimera have be construct in which the n - terminal half of arac provide dimerization and arabinose responsiveness and the c - terminal half provide binding and transcription - activation capability . the construction of such functional chimera demonstrate that arac possess a modular structure , with independent domain capable of dimerize and of bind to dna . we be grateful to dr .

Loop - size lower limit . deletion be generate to move arao2 and arai closer together , and the candidate retain intact arao2 and cap binding site be further characterize . a deletion of 100 bp , leave a loop of 111 bp , show normal repression . it be a surprise that loop as small as this should form , since significant work be require to bend 100 bp of dna into a circle . that be , the persistence length of dna in physiological buffer be about 140 bp . therefore , we test whether the loop be between araI and arao2 by mutational analysis , as be do for the 299 - bp spacing plasmid , and find that the arai and arao2 site in a plasmid contain the 146 - bp spacing be involve in a small repression loop . the smallest possible spacing between araI and arao2 that will not damage either site or the intervene cap site be 70 bp . delete or damage the cap site substantially lower the repress and induce level of pbad -lrb- 1 , 30 -rrb- , and this would interfere with interpretation of datum . in the absence of a functional cap binding site , however , loop between araI and arao2 can be detect by its dramatic reduction of the arabinose - induce level of pbad activity when somewhat elevated level of arac protein be provide . to examine the ability to form small loop , we construct another arac - overproduce plasmid , pdl5 , which be compatible with the spacing mutant plasmid so that both the hypersynthesis plasmid and the pbad - lacz plasmid could be stably maintain in cell . the inducibility of pbad in this system as a function of the arai - arao2 spacing be compare to the repression ability in the cap ' plasmid with the same spacing . as show in fig . 3c , both inducibility in the capsystem and repression in the cap ' system show identical loop size dependency for loop around 140 bp and loop around 230 bp . that be , the maximum and minima of the basal level occur at the same loop size as the maximum and minima of the induce level . therefore , we extend we examination of loop formation to spacing of less than 70 bp between aral and arao2 when part or all of the cap site be delete . the inducibility of pbad in the plasmid with the cap site delete oscillate as the spacing between aral and arao2 vary as show in fig . 3c . this oscillation retain the same periodicity of about 11 bp and the same phase as the oscillation in the basal level observe with the plasmid 4 aw 3 * - 2 ' a e < 1 0 9 10 11 12 13 periodicity , bp -lrb- 0 e 2 0 a . 600 ' 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 Loop size , bp b i : 1 e a . -lrb- 10 c . 6000 3000 0 I I I I ii11i I 1 1 1 I I I c l ... w ~ ~ . ivjba - . - . .

Richardson et al . analyze change in the helical repeat that be generate by vary the link number deficit in vitro . they find a repeat of 11.07 for of = - 0.061 and a repeat of 10.95 for o - = - 0.031 very similar to we in vivo finding . energetic of Loop formation . the fact that very small loop can form when arao2 and araf be correctly orient suggest that arac protein must bend significantly in the formation of these loop . clearly , the actual loop process be aid by the supercoiling present in vivo -lrb- 2 , 31 , 32 -rrb- , and the result of calculation of the energy depend on the physical model choose for loop . nonetheless , as a crude approximation , we determine the approximate relative work necessary to form loop of various size if the protein have a fix diameter but be highly flexible . as the loop size decrease , the work require for loop formation first increase , then decline . the decline be obtain when the protein bent appreciably to form the loop , ultimately reach a region of somewhat dubious physical significance . we can not easily estimate the propensity to loop as a function of loop size from these consideration , since k = exp -lrb- - AG / r7 -rrb- and AG = ah - tas . we have estimate relative change in h but can not estimate as for loop formation . discussion the l - arabinose operon of e . coli have long be know to be positively and negatively regulate by arac . binding arac protein at araI and at arao2 , site separate by 211 bp , and association of these two protein to form a dna loop be necessary for the negative regulation or repression of the arabad promoter pbad -lrb- 1 - 4 -rrb- . as dna looping appear to be a wide - spread and versatile mechanism utilize in gene regulation , we have explore the parameter of loop in the ara system . we find that separate araI and arao2 by more than about 500 bp eliminate detectable repression . at the other extreme , no lower limit to they spacing be find , imply that arac protein possess significant flexibility . as the spacing between arao2 and arai vary , the level of expression of pbad oscillate with a period of about 11.1 bp , suggest that in vivo the dna between araI and araO2 possess a helical repeat of about 11.1 bp per turn . we be surprise at the relatively small upper limit to the ara loop size . in the deo system a small amount of loop be detectable when the relevant operator site be separate by as much as 5000 bp . similarly , the enhancer of eukary - 480 Biochemistry : Lee and Schleif otic gene likely utilize dna looping and they often function from distance exceed 500 bp . certainly , however , as the distance separate arai and arao2 increase , loop must become more difficult because of the lowered concentration of one site in the presence of the other - i . e . , for entropic reason . as a first approximation to estimate distance effect on loop , we might estimate the concentration of arao2 in the presence of arai by assume the intervene dna be a long polymer with random angle between stiff segment . this be equivalent to a three - dimensional random walk , and yield concentration as a function of the distance f between the site vary as U - 3 ! 2 . if the loop size be increase from 300 to 500 bp , this relationship predict a decrease in concentration of one site in the presence of the other by 54 % . this result be at significant variance with the datum present in fig . 2 in which the effective concentration must change by much more so that the repression change from full to undetectable over this range . presumably the estimation be poor because of the unknown orientation and position requirement of aral and arao2 for loop in addition to the unknown effect of dna supercoiling and binding by other protein . we experimental result that there be no lower size limit for the ara loop suggest that arac protein be flexible . this would have to be a particular flexibility however . on one hand the protein appear free to bend parallel to the dna . on the other hand , the fact that misorient arai and arao2 interfere with repression imply that the protein be not significantly free to bend in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the dna . if we assume the protein be completely free to bend in the direction require to form small loop and that it hold the arai and arao2 site a fixed distance apart , we can approximately determine the loop shape and the relative work require for formation . as we have discuss , larger loop , while energetically more easily form , be less favor for entropic reason . one interesting outcome of the loop energetic calculation be the apparently greater work require to form a loop of about 100 bp . this maximum may correspond to the relatively poor repression see for loop of 140 - 160 bp -lrb- fig . 3b -rrb- . we finding of the 11.1 - bp periodicity of ara pbad repression raise the question of the structure of dna in vivo . a number of experiment have show that the helical repeat of linear dna in vitro be about 10.5 bp per turn -lrb- 6 - 8 -rrb- . special sequence can give rise to different helical repeat - e . g . , 10.0 ± 0.1 bp per turn with poly -lrb- da -rrb- - poly -lrb- dt -rrb- and 13.6 bp per turn with poly -lrb- dg - dc -rrb- - poly -lrb- dg - dc -rrb- -lrb- 37 , 38 -rrb- , but sequence analysis of the ara pbad regulatory region reveal no special base distribution or sequence feature with periodicity of 10 - 12 bp . additionally , the independence of the oscillation cycle with various size of spacing and with various combination of sequence by random deletion and insertion nearly exclude the possibility that the sequence alone of the ara regulatory region be responsible for the 11.1 - bp periodicity we observe . we suspect that the link number deficit of e . coli dna shift the average helical repeat from its relax value of 10.5 bp per turn to around 11.1 . a link number deficit can generate a torsion that generate supercoiling . this same torsion be in a direction that it could also act to unwind the dna . in fact , the apparent supercoiling density in vivo measure on a plasmid be appreciably less than its probable link number deficit . if the remainder of the link number deficit be apply to untwist the dna , the helical repeat could approach 11 bp per turn .

Wild - type and narp null strain exhibit similar pattern of 4 -lrb- fdng - iacz -rrb- expression , namely , strong induction by nitrate and weak induction by nitrite . the narl null strain exhibit weak nitrate and nitrite induction . however , the narl narp double - null strain , like the narx narq strain , be devoid of -lrb- d -lrb- fdng - lacz -rrb- induction by either nitrate or nitrite . this show that the narp protein be responsible for the residual induction observe in narl null strain . we do not know how or where the narp protein act in controllingfdng operon expression . in narl + strain , irrespective of narp genotype , introduction of a narq null allele have only a small effect on nitrate and nitrite induction of 4 ' -lrb- fdng - lacz -rrb- expression , as expect from previous observation . however , the situation be quite different in the narx null derivative , where nitrite induction be elevated to nearly the same level as nitrate induction in the wild type . this be a very striking result , for it provide a clear - cut regulatory phenotype for a narx null narq + strain -lrb- 14 , 29 -rrb- . we have argue previously that the narx protein play a negative role in narl - mediate gene expression -lrb- 8 , 15 -rrb- . this observation provide clear evidence for a negative function of the narx protein : eliminate narx -lrb- but not narq -rrb- by mutation cause significant narl - dependent induction of gene expression in the presence of nitrite . a interpretation of this result , that nitrite be a efficient -lrb- ?

-lrb- narg - lacz -rrb- expression , as observe also with -lrb- ? -lrb- fdng - lacz -rrb- expression -lrb- compare Tables 3 and 4 -rrb- . conversely , nitrite induction of cf -lrb- narg - lacz -rrb- expression in the narq null strain be less efficient than in the wild type -lrb- compare Tables 3 and 4 -rrb- . as describe above , we believe that these observation reflect a negative regulatory role for the narx + gene in nitrite regulation . regulation of frd4 operon expression . expression of the frda operon be repress approximately 10 - fold by nitrate , and this repression be abolish by narl null allele -lrb- 17 , 40 -rrb- . either the narx or narq protein be sufficient for full repression -lrb- 5 , 29 -rrb- , while repression be abolish in a narx narq double - null strain . f -lrb- frda - lacz -rrb- expression be slightly stimulate by nitrite . again , a narp null allele have no effect on -lrb- i -lrb- frda - lacz -rrb- expression , while a narl null allele abolish nitrate repression irrespective of the presence of narp + . thus , the narp gene have no effect on f -lrb- frda - lacz -rrb- expression . Nitrite be a effective repressor of f -lrb- frda - lacz -rrb- expression in a narx null mutant , while it be without effect in a narq null strain and in the narx narq double - null strain . again , we believe that nitrite repression in the narx null strain reflect a negative regulatory role for the narx protein . hierarchy of narl - mediated regulation . several observation have lead we to believe that expression of the narg , fdng , and frda operon be differentially sensitive to narlmediated regulation . first , narx insertion allele , which reduce -lrb- but do not eliminate -rrb- narl gene expression through polarity , cause only a slight decrease in nitrate induction of narg operon induction while virtually eliminate nitrate repression offrda operon expression -lrb- 14 , 41 -rrb- . nitrate induction of fdng operon expression in such strain be decrease by a greater extent than be narg expression , but it be not eliminate . these observation suggest a hierarchy of narg > fdng > frda with respect to the threshold of narl - phosphate necessary for regulation . other observation with missense constitutive allele of narl and narx support this hierarchy : in each case , the constitutive allele cause relatively high - level expression of 1d -lrb- narglacz -rrb- , intermediate expression of fd -lrb- fdng - lacz -rrb- , and little or no repression of 4 ? -lrb- frda - lacz -rrb- . . 4 -lrb- narg - lacz -rrb- expression in nar regulatory mutant 13 - galactosidase sp act ' Genotypea narl + narp + narl narp + narl + narp narl narp nonec + no3 '' c + no2 '' c none + no3 - + no2 - none + no3 - + no2 - none + no3 - + no2 - narx + narq + 33 3,100 380 30 23 25 32 2,860 280 25 28 31 narx narq + 57 2,880 3,320 29 21 23 _ _ d narx + narq 30 2,950 140 narx narq 29 29 34 a combination of narl , narp , narx , and narq wild - type or null allele as indicate . b 13 - galactosidase specific activity be measure as describe in Materials and method and be express in Miller unit . c anaerobic growth with no acceptor -lrb- none -rrb- , with nitrate -lrb- + no3 - -rrb- , or with nitrite -lrb- + no2 - -rrb- as indicate . d _ , not determine .

Nitrite induction of ' I -lrb- narg - lacz -rrb- expression be greater than that of 41 -lrb- fdng - lacz -rrb- expression , while ' f -lrb- frdalacz -rrb- expression be essentially indifferent to nitrite . take together with the above - describe result , this reflect , in we opinion , differential sensitivity of the various control region to the amount of narl - phosphate . relatively low level of narl - phosphate seem to be sufficient for substantial narg operon induction , while relatively high level of narl - phosphate seem to be require forfrda operon repression . if the narx protein be predominantly -lrb- but not exclusively -rrb- a narl - phosphate phosphatase in the presence of nitrite , then relatively little narl - phosphate would accumulate in wild - type cell grow with nitrite . this low level of narl - phosphate would be sufficient for relatively strong ' ? -lrb- narg - lacz -rrb- expression but insufficient for observable d -lrb- frda - lacz -rrb- repression . the arrangement of narl protein - bind site in the narg and fdng operon control region be quite different -lrb- 13 , 22 -rrb- , and the control region also differ in they requirement for a accessory factor , integration host factor . thus , the differential sensitivity of these two control region for narl - phosphate could reflect different binding - site affinity or different mechanism of transcription activation . likewise , the level of narl - phosphate necessary to repress frda operon expression depend on binding affinity and mode of action . therefore , the mechanistic basis for this hierarchy of sensitivity to narl - mediated regulation be currently unknown . regulation of aeg - 93 -lrb- nri -rrb- operon expression . expression of ' f -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- be induce by nitrate in a narl null strain . this regulation , which be analogous to but distinct from that of the aeg - 46.5 operon , also suggest the existence of a nitrate - responsive transcription factor in addition to the narl protein . thus , we examine 4 -rrb- -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression in response to nitrate and nitrite in the various nar regulatory gene mutant . in narl + strain , fd -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression be efficiently induce by nitrite but not nitrate irrespective of the narp gene . by contrast , f -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression in the narp + narl null strain be induce equally well by either nitrate or nitrite . this show that the narl protein repress ' I -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression in response to nitrate but activate expression in response to nitrite . the narp protein , by contrast , mediate activation by both nitrate and nitrite . in the narl null narp + strain , either narx + or narq + be sufficient for full induction by either nitrate or nitrite , demonstrate again that either the narx or narq protein can activate the narp protein in response to either nitrate or nitrite . in the absence of nitrate and nitrite , f -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression be elevated in the narq narl null strain . this imply that the narq protein negatively regulate the narp protein , much like the narx protein negatively regulate the narl protein . however , basal expression of 4d -lrb- aeg - 46.5 - lacz -rrb- be not elevated in the narq narl strain . regulation by nitrate and nitrite follow essentially identical pattern in narl + strain , irrespective of the presence of the narp gene . this show that narl - mediate repression be phenotypically dominant to narp - mediated activation . that the same regulatory pattern be observe in both narl + narp + and narl + narp null strain imply that induction of ' f -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression in narl + strain reflect narl - mediated activation . although more complicated hypothesis be not exclude , this be the simplest one that explain currently available datum . in narl + strain , nitrate prevent ed -lrb- aeg -

phosphate act to repress ' f -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression , irrespective of the presence of narpphosphate . the pattern of regulation by nitrite be quite different . in narx + strain , nitrite be a effective inducer of narlmediated f -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression . by contrast , in the narx null narq + strain , nitrite have little effect on NarLmediated ' i -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression . we have argue above that narx + strain have relatively low level of NarLphosphate when culture in the presence of nitrite , while narx null narq + strain accumulate relatively high level of narl - phosphate . thus , the datum for the single - sensor mutant suggest that narl - mediated induction of cf -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression occur only when narl - phosphate level be relatively low -lrb- nitrite - grow narx + culture -rrb- . when narl - phosphate level be relatively high -lrb- nitrate - grown culture and nitrite - grow narx null narq + culture -rrb- , f -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- be not express . this hypothesis seemingly present a paradox . we conclude above that higher level of narl - phosphate result in more efficient induction of fdng operon expression , for example , but here we argue that lower level of NarLphosphate result in more efficient induction of aeg - 93 -lrb- nrf -rrb- operon expression . can these idea be reconcile ? a difference in these model be that high level of narl - phosphate be postulate to repress aeg - 93 -lrb- ntf -rrb- operon expression , while the narl protein do not repress fdng operon expression under any condition . thus , narl - phosphate play a dual role at the aeg - 93 -lrb- ntf -rrb- control region . a explanation for this dichotomy follow the model for ompr - mediated regulation of the ompf gene -lrb- 31 , 33 , 34 -rrb- . Silhavy and student have interpret they genetic analysis to reveal ompf gene activation when ompr - phosphate level be relatively low and ompf gene repression when ompr - phosphate level be relatively high . the key to this model be that repression -lrb- by high level of ompr - phosphate -rrb- be phenotypically dominant to activation -lrb- by low level of ompr - phosphate -rrb- . we own genetic analysis of aeg - 93 -lrb- nrf -rrb- regulation be much less advanced than that for the ompf gene , but this type of model provide a attractive work hypothesis to guide future experimentation . residual nitrate and nitrite induction of ' f -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression remain in narl narp double - null , narx narq double - null , and all combination of triple - null strain . in fact , some induction remain even in the quadruplenull mutant . this imply that yet a third nitrate - and nitrite - responsive regulatory system be involve in regulate aeg - 93 -lrb- nrf -rrb- operon expression . elucidation of this system remain a challenge for future work . finally , we examine the effect of a fnr null allele on ' t -lrb- aeg - 93 - lacz -rrb- expression in narl and narp strain . expression be very low irrespective of nar genotype -lrb- datum not show -rrb- , show that the fnr mutation be epistatic to narl and narp mutation , as expect . the growth physiology of the aeg - 93 -lrb- nrf -rrb- insertion strain be test in parallel with that of the aeg - 46.5 strain -lrb- see above -rrb- , and again no difference from that of the wild type be observe -lrb- datum not show -rrb- . hypothesis . the interplay between two response regulator , two sensor , two regulatory metabolite , and five target operon inevitably mean that complex and diverse regulatory interaction be involve in different context . we have attempt to organize and summarize we finding and interpretation in a comprehensive hypothesis . this be a i efrr4 fdng NITRATE fl narg lb NITRATE iB ~ ~ ~ ~ aeg - 93 ' d11g ' ' 911g ' ~ ~ ~ sg46 . none Q 0 fdng ~ ~ ~ NITRITE l l m nag d & 411 av - 93 e aeg - 46.5 j . bacteriol . none NITRITE FIG . 4 . hypothesis for nitrate - and nitrite - regulate gene expression . see text for detail . activation and repression of target operon expression be indicate by + and - , respectively . strong interaction be box , while relatively weak interaction be circle . narl and narp be represent by circle l and circle p , respectively , while the phosphorylated form be represent by the same letter box . the sensor narx and narq be represent by x and Q , respectively . in the presence of nitrite , a relatively small proportion of narl molecule be phosphorylate . target operon be as follow : frda , fumarate reductase ; fdnG , formate dehydrogenase - n ; narg , nitrate reductase ; aeg - 46.5 , anaerobically express gene of unknown function at 46.5 map unit ; aeg - 93 , probably formatenitrite reductase -lrb- nrf -rrb- . work hypothesis which we believe adequately explain most of the currently available datum , although alternate explanation exist for some point . this hypothesis , depict schematically in fig . 4 , will help to guide future work aim at understand nitrate and nitrite control of anaerobic respiratory gene expression . for reference , summarize the observe regulatory pattern . first , consider narl - mediated regulation . in the presence of nitrate , either the narx or narq protein be sufficient to form high level of narl - phosphate . this amount of NarLphosphate fully activate narg and fdng operon expression and fully repress frda , aeg - 46.5 , and aeg - 93 -lrb- nt - -rrb- operon expression . the narx protein also negatively regulate the narl protein by act as a narl - phosphate phosphatase in the absence of nitrate . the narq protein apparently do not have a similar negative role -lrb- 29 ; and this work -rrb- . in the presence of nitrite , the narq protein act to phosphorylate narl with a efficiency approach that see in nitrate - grown culture . however , the narx protein act predominantly as a narl - phosphate phosphatase , although some narl kinase activity be also present . the net effect be that only intermediate level of narl - phosphate accumulate in wild - type nitrite - grow cell . this intermediate level of narl - phosphate activate the narg operon relatively efficiently , activate the fdng operon and repress the aeg - 46.5 operon relatively weakly , and have no effect on expression of the frda operon . this intermediate level of narl - phosphate be insufficient to repress expression of the aeg - 93 -lrb- nrf -rrb- operon and instead actually activate its expression . second , consider narp - mediated regulation . the narp protein apparently have no effect on narg or frda operon expression . in the presence of nitrate or nitrite , the narp protein be phosphorylate by either narq or narx to ap - vol . 175 , 1993 narp , a SECOND NITRATE RESPONSE REGULATOR 3267 . summary of nar regulatory gene product actiona Action in the presence of : Operon function Nitrateb Nitriteb narGHJI Nitrate reductase narl -lrb- x , Q -rrb- activate ;

in every case , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- bind as well as or more tightly -lrb- i . e . , have a lower k d -lsb- equilibrium dissociation constant -rrb- than wt mara . for several promoter marbox this change be dramatic : the k d drop from > > 150 to 50 for inaa , from 200 to 75 for nfsb , and from > > 150 nm to ~ 100 nm for both ybjc and yhbw . in spite of this , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- activation be greater than that of WT MarA for inaA , sodA , and ybjc ; it be comparable to that of WT MarA for micf and less than that of WT MarA for fumC , mdab , nfsb , and ybhw -lrb- and fig . 1 -rrb- . we conclude that the WT glutamic acid of mara at position 89 be a inhibitor of mara binding to many marbox . in a effort to understand why e89 be inhibitory , we examine the sequence of the 14 marbox for which we have datum . we notice that five haveatatposition 12 and that the binding to none of these sequence be increase by the e89a substitution -lrb- less than 1.7 - fold -rrb- . in contrast , of the remain nine sequence that do not have atatthis position , the binding of e89a be increase for six of they by > 2.5 - fold and for the seventh by 1.7 - fold ; only two do not show increase binding . although the cocrystal structure of mara with the marrab marbox dna -lrb- with atatposition 12 -rrb- indicate no interaction between the two molecule at this position , we consider the possibility that steric hindrance between the marbox dna and mara could limit activation by mara when position 12 be not a t residue -lrb- see the discussion for a fuller treatment -rrb- . to examine one facet of this possibility , namely , that the glutamic acid side chain of e89 sterically inhibit interaction with marbox dna lack atatposition 12 , we test the effect of several amino acid substitution at residue 89 on the fpr : : lacz fusion and the mdtg : : lacz fusion , the two fusion that show the greatest effect of e89a on activation -lrb- see above -rrb- . plasmid carry WT MarA , the mara variant mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- -lrb- with a nonpolar single methyl group side chain -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89g -rrb- -lrb- with no side chain -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89d -rrb- -lrb- with a side chain one methylene group shorter than glutamic acid -rrb- , mara -lrb- e89v -rrb- -lrb- with the amino acid present at the corresponding position of soxs and have a dimethyl methylene side chain , -rrb- , wt soxs , and soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- be introduce into these fusion and assay for β - galactosidase . again , activation of these promoter by soxs be much greater than that by mara . similarly , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- be considerably more active than wt mara . in contrast , the e89d variant be less active than wt mara for fpr and completely inactive -lrb- indistinguishable from the control plasmid -rrb- for mdtg . e89g be approximately twice as active as WT MarA for fpr and 4 - fold more active for mdtg although for both promoter it be considerably less active than e89a . the e89v variant be marginally more active than the WT for both promoter but substantially less so than e89a . soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- reduce the activation of these promoter relative to wt soxs , but soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- be still more active than wt mara . -lrb- the activation show here be greater than those apparent in because the expression of the plasmid carry mara , soxs , and they mutant be not entirely shut off by laci q so that the increase express in appear smaller . -rrb- as outline in the Discussion , these result , namely , -lrb- i -rrb- that variant e89d be virtually inactive , -lrb- ii -rrb- that e89g be very active although to a lesser extent than e89a , -lrb- iii -rrb- that e89v be only marginally more active than the WT , and -lrb- iv -rrb- that soxs -lrb- v83e -rrb- have reduce activation although not to the low level express by WT MarA , be consistent with the possibility that that the side chain of e89 sterically inhibit interaction with the dna for marbox sequence lack atat position 12 . if , as outline above and present in greater detail in the Discussion , steric interference with the phosphate between position 12 and 13 and the glutamic acid side chain at position 89 be responsible for the very poor activation of promoter such as fpr , then it would be predict that binding of WT MarA to the fpr marbox would be enhance if that phosphate be absent . we therefore compare the binding affinity of WT MarA to either a 36 - bp double - strand dna contain the marbox sequence of fpr or with dsdna of the same sequence and length but prepare so that the phosphate linkage between position 12 and 13 of the marbox be eliminate -lrb- see Materials and method -rrb- . again -lrb- fig . 2 and -rrb- , mara bind very poorly to the fpr marbox . however , binding increase significantly when the fpr dna lack the phosphate group between position 12 and 13 -lrb- fig . 4a and b -rrb- . in contrast , soxs bind more tightly to dsdna than to the discontinuous dna -lrb- fig . 4b -rrb- . when the phosphate located 3 nt farther upstream -lrb- between position 9 and 10 -rrb- be absent , no significant alteration in binding be observe although a small increase be observe when the phosphate between position 15 and 16 be absent . we conclude that the phosphate group between nt 12 and 13 of the consensus sequence inhibit the ability of mara to bind . activation and marbox binding by mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- . the only other mara mutation find here to differ significantly from WT MarA in the activation of class i promoter be q91a . of the seven class i promoter examine , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- activate the acrab , marrab , and zwf promoter to similar extent as WT MarA but activate acna , fpr , mdtg , and poxB to only 60 % or less of MarA WT level -lrb- ; see also below -rrb- . for the nine class ii promoter , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- significantly reduce the activation of fumc , inaa , micf , pqia , and ybjc but have no significant effect on nfsb , mdab , soda , oryhbw . mara - -lrb- q91 -rrb- have be identify as form van der waals interaction with the methyl group of the two thymidine that be complementary to the adenine at position 17 and 18 of the consensus sequence . thus , it would be expect that the q91a substitution might reduce activation of the seven class ii promoter that have at least one a at position 17 or 18 but not the two promoter , nfsb and soda , that have no a residue at these position . indeed , nfsb and soda be among the promoter that q91a activate to the same extent as WT MarA . since q91a reduce the expression of four of the seven class i promoter and four of the nine class ii promoter , we result be inconsistent with the proposition that q91 be principally require for interaction at class ii promoter , as have be propose for the analogous site -lrb- q85 -rrb- in soxs . for the majority of these promoter , the gel mobility assay for binding of mara to marbox be insufficiently precise to determine whether there be a correlation between binding and activation by mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- relative to mara . among the class i promoter that exhibit measurable binding to mara , mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- show no greater binding or activation for acrab , a modest reduction in activation and binding for mdtg and zwf , and a reduction in binding but not in activation for marrab . a modest reduction in binding with a small increase in activation be see for the class ii mdab promoter . although not observe in these experiment , a more detailed analysis of the binding of mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- to the micf marbox -lrb- use protein without the he 6 tag -rrb- show a very small reduction in bind concomitant with the reduce ability of mara -lrb- q91a -rrb- to activate the class ii micf promoter . thus , relative to mara , there may be a correlation between activation and binding for q91a at class i promoter , but none be obvious with regard to the class ii promoter . activation of superoxide resistance by mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- . if the glutamic acid at position 89 of mara be a major determinant in vivo of the reduce activity of mara at many promoter where soxs be more active , we would expect cell carry mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- to be more resistant to superoxide than cell carry WT MarA . this be test with gradient plate assay of sensitivity to two superoxide - generate compound , phenazine methosulfate -lrb- pms -rrb- and menadione . cell constitutively express mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- be more resistant than wt mara to pms -lrb- 1.7 - fold -rrb- and , to a lesser extent , to menadione -lrb- 1.3 - fold -rrb- . comparable mic with soxs for pm be 1.6 - fold and for menadione 2.0 - fold . clearly , mara -lrb- e89a -rrb- activate superoxide resistance to a greater extent than wt mara . curiously , the q91a substitution have no effect on resistance to the superoxide generator pms -lrb- mic of 35 μm for both the q91a mutant and the WT MarA -rrb- but lower resistance to the superoxide generator menadione -lrb- mic of 0.9 mm for the q91a mutant and 1.8 mm for the WT -rrb- . discussion . the mara - soxs - Rob regulon of e . coli consist of a variety of gene that enable cell to adapt to multiple stress . it contain gene that render the cell multidrug and organicsolvent resistant -lrb- acrab , tolc , and micf -rrb- and that defend against superoxide stress -lrb- e . g . , acna , fpr , fumc , nfsa , soda , and zwf -rrb- -lrb- 1 , 2 , 5 , 26 , 31 , 33 -rrb- . not surprisingly , there be quantitative difference in the extent of activation of particular promoter by the paralogous activator so that the phenotypic outcome depend on which activator be upregulate -lrb- 2 , 26 , 34 , 43 -rrb- . e89 inhibition . we have show here that the mara glutamic acid residue e89 be responsible for decrease the binding of WT MarA relative to soxs for the class i marbox promoter , acna , mdtg , fpr , and zwf , thereby decrease the relative activation of these promoter and hence the resistance engender to superoxide by mara . we think the follow may explain these result . a detail of the mara structure show that e89 be orient in the cocrystal with its acidic group expose to the solvent away from the dna backbone . in so do , methyl hydrogen on the β - and - carbon be positioned restrictively close to a oxygen of the phosphate group between basis t12 and g13 of the marrab marbox . even this orientation of e89 be only possible as the result of a small `` clash '' -lrb- as predict by the MolProbity program -lsb- http : / / molprobity . biochem . duke . edu / -rsb- -rrb- between e89 and s90 that permit the rotation of e89 into the mara core and away from the dna backbone .
