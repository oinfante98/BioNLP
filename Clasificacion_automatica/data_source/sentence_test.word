This is reasonable because the binding of a regulatory protein to the site for self - regulation may be weaker than the other binding sites of the regulon , and there may be circumstantial evidence for the flexibility of regulator -- regulon relationship in that regulatory proteins have changed their binding sites on the genome , sometimes alternating their binding sites in the evolutionary process . 
No significant difference in DNA - binding activity was noted when the phosphorylation reaction was allowed to proceed for up to 4hatroom temperature , and maximal activity was attained after 10 min of incubation .

The activity of CA8306 -LRB- cya -RRB- harboring these clones was higher in the presence of cAMP , suggesting that gntK Figure 2 -LRB- B -RRB- -LRB- legend on page 783 -RRB- 782 gntRKU Operon from E . coli expression is controlled by cAMP - CRP . 
The reason why a clone containing only gntK with positive fermentation was isolated from the gntT background , might be depletion of the repressor by its binding to the gntK operator , thus leading to expression of the gntKU operon .

F5 | F6 F7 FIG . 1 . ara regulatory region and the restriction fragments used in this work . Divergent transcription and translation of the araBAD operon on the left and the araC gene on the right originate within the regulatory region . Transcriptional start points for araB and araC are located at + 1 and - 148 ; translational start points are at + 28 and - 312 , respectively . Numbering of bases is relative to the direction of the araBAD operon . Solid lines denote coding regions of DNA , and crosshatched lines denote regions that are transcribed but not translated . The CAP without cAMP did not protect DNA . At 2.5 AuM cAMP , it protected a single region located between the A and B sites -LRB- designated CAP site in Figs . 2 and 3 -RRB- . At 250 AM cAMP , the CAP protected an additional region , at - 130 to - 140 , against DNase digestion -LRB- not shown in Fig . 2 , but see Fig . 3D -RRB- , which was not detectable with the methylation protection test -LRB- see Fig . 3B -RRB- . This second CAP site lies entirely within the A site olymerase binding sites at PBAD and PC were determined under conditions that activate their respective transcriptions in vitro . For PBAD , polymerase was incubated with DNA , P2 , CAP , and cAMP , and then the mixture was treated with dimethylsulfate or with DNase I . Under these conditions , we found that the A site , the CAP site , and the B site were all protected , showing the combined protection patterns of araC and CAP . In addition , there was an enhancement of methylation ofthe G res - POLYMERASE SITE IN PBAD I 10 1 - 10 | - 20 - - Proc . Nati . Acad . Sci . USA 78 753 idue at - 15 , which is associated with the presence ofRNA polymerase -LRB- see Fig . 3A -RRB- . In the DNase I protection test , we found that the polymerase protected a segment of DNA extending from - 39 to at least + 24 -LRB- see Fig . 5E -RRB- . For protection of Pc , polymerase was incubated with DNA , CAP , and cAMP before methylation or DNase I digestion . Under these conditions , in addition to the CAP protection pattern , the A residues at - 114 and - 137 showed reduced methylation , and the region from - 105 to the end of the fragment at - 170 was protected against DNase I . In the presence of polymerase , the second , lower - affinity CAP site disappeared from the protection pattern , suggesting that the polymerase prevents CAP from binding to this site . The A Site Is a '' Classical '' Operator for the araC Gene . The congruency of the RNA polymerase binding site at Pc with the A site is evident from examination of their positions . This suggests that the A site may be the operator locus for the repression ofaraC by its own product . If this were true , one might expect to find the following : -LRB- i -RRB- As the activity of Pc is reduced in vivo by introducing an araC + gene , with or without L - arabinose in the medium , this operator may be able to bind either P1 or P2 and -LRB- ii -RRB- the affinity of the operator for binding araC protein should be strong enough to compete successfully with polymerase binding . We examined the ability of the A site to bind P1 . The araC protein solution was exhaustively dialyzed to remove all traces of arabinose . Varying concentrations of this preparation were then incubated with a constant amount of DNA in the presence or absence of added L - arabinose . The mixtures were subjected to digestion with DNase I . The results showed that -LRB- i -RRB- the A site can bind either P1 or P2 , whereas the B site , especially the portion designated B2 , binds only P2 ; -LRB- ii -RRB- the A site has a greater affinity for P2 than for P1 -LRB- for complete protection , the protein / DNA ratio is 20 for P1 and 2 for P2 -RRB- ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- the anti - inducer D - fucose , an analog of L - arabinose that competitively inhibits araBAD transcription , confers on the araC protein a conformation -LRB- P1 ' -RRB- that has no affinity for the B2 site and an affinity for the A site intermediate between those of P2 and P1 o show that binding at the A site interferes with Pc activity , a set of transcription assays was set up in which the concentrations of araC protein and DNA paralleled those described in B SITE 0 50 - 6qs -LSB- - 70 -RSB- F - 0 TTTCACTCCATCCAAAAAAACGGGTATGGAGAAACAGTAGAGAGTTGCGATAAAAAGCGTCAG - GTAGGATCC & CTAATCT TATGrATAAAAAT4CTATGGCATAGC I r - U AAAGTGAGGTAGGTTTTTTTGCCCATACCTCTTTGTCATCTCTCAACGCTATTTTTCGCAGTCCATCCTAGcC8ATTAGAATACCTATTTTTAC ATACC TRANSCRIPTIONAL START - J JIA I AlI CAP SITE POLYMERASE SITE IN Pc AAAGT As looC -LSB- TG 1A1G - 120 - 1401 1 - 150 - 160 - 170 AGTT , - AC 00CGT TTTTCTGCCGTGATTATAGAC ; CTTTTGTTACGCGTTTTGTCATGGCTTTGGTCCCG GTCGTTTCACAC GCACA TTAGTTACACCTGAAAAGACGGCACTAATA TCTGTGAAAACAATGCGCAAAACAGTACCGAAACCAGGGC AU A ... .

A mutation in aral and a known mutation in araC led to the loss of araI2 binding , while binding to aral -LSB- was unaffected . Both mutants failed to activate the promoter of the araBAD operon . We propose that aral2 occupancy by AraC protein leads to RNA polymerase recognition of the araBAD promoter and that arall acts as a switch mechanism allowing both the repressor and the activator forms of AraC protein to regulate the araBAD promoter . Transcription initiation at the promoter of the Escherichia coli araBAD operon is regulated both positively and negatively by the AraC protein . The site of AraC interaction required for activation -LRB- araI -RRB- is located very close to the RNA polymerase binding site -LRB- 2 - 4 -RRB- , whereas the site for repression -LRB- araO2 -RRB- is located at a considerable distance from the start point of araBAD transcription -LRB- 5 - 8 -RRB- . Recently , there has been considerable effort directed toward understanding how the araBAD promoter is down - regulated by a farupstream site -LRB- 7 , 9 , 10 -RRB- , whereas the mechanism of araBAD activation upon the addition of inducer remains largely unexplored . It is well known that strains deleted of the araO2 site still require L - arabinose to initiate transcription of araBAD , a fact that indicates that the relief of repression is not responsible for promoter activation . In cells containing araO2 , the relief of repression accompanies activation but is not the cause of it . Promoter activation must require some ligand - induced event at araL . The state of aral occupancy by AraC protein is an important issue in understanding the mechanism of promoter activation , yet , with one exception -LRB- ref . 10 ; however , see Discussion -RRB- , there has been no experiment reported that searched for a qualitative change in the interaction of AraC protein with araf upon induction . In this paper , we present data showing that , in the absence of the ligand L - arabinose , AraC protein binds to two turns on the DNA . The addition of arabinose leads to binding to an additional downstream sequence , representing two more turns on the DNA . We propose that the shift in the binding at araI from a two - turn occupancy to a four - turn occupancy corresponds to the transition from an inactive to an active promoter . Thus , the araI site is divisible into two regions , which we designate araIf and araI2 . In the absence of arabinose , AraC protein can bind only ara ! , , but the addition of inducer allows AraC protein to bind both araIf and aral2 . The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment . This article must therefore be hereby marked '' advertisement '' in accordance with 18 U . S .

The overlapping and divergent promoters of araBAD -LRB- PBAD -RRB- and araC -LRB- Pc -RRB- are shown with the positions of the contact sites of RNA polymerase -LRB- RNA pol -RRB- , AraC protein -LRB- AraI , AraO , , and AraO2 -RRB- , and the cAMP binding protein -LRB- CAP -RRB- . The Pc RNA polymerase binding site -LRB- open box -RRB- overlaps AraO , -LRB- stippled box -RRB- . The start points and directions of transcription are indicated by arrows . The numbers mark positions of nucleotides relative to the start point of araBAD transcription . Further evidence for two discrete states of aral occupancy was obtained from two mutants , one a promoter mutant and the other an araC gene mutant . These mutants are defective in only araI2 binding , and both fail to activate the araBAD promoter . MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolation of AraC Protein . AraC protein was isolated from a hyperproducing strain harboring a plasmid that carried a wild - type araC allele fused to the tac promoter . Details of the construction of the overproducing plasmid will be presented elsewhere -LRB- C . F . , unpublished data -RRB- . For the isolation of AraC protein , cells were cultivated in 8 liters of minimal glycerol ampicillin medium containing per liter 7.0 g of K2HPO4 , 3.0 g of KH2PO4 , 1 g of -LRB- NH4 -RRB- 2SO4 , 0.1 g of MgSO4 - 7H2O , 4 mg of thiamine , 2.0 ml of glycerol , and 50 mg of sodium ampicillin and were induced with 100 AM isopropyl 8 - D - thiogalactoside . Purification steps were as described . The final product had an A280 - to - A260 ratio of 1.9 and appeared homogeneous by electrophoretic analysis in NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gels . Fig . 2 illustrates samples taken at successive steps during the isolation of AraC protein . Spectrophotometric Measurement of AraC Concentration . The concentrations of purified AraC protein were determined spectrophotometrically by using the factor A260 , 1 mg / ml = 1.88 . This value was obtained by amino acid analysis as follows . The absorbancy of a purified AraC protein solution in buffer was first determined against a buffer blank . Of this solution , 3.0 ml was then exhaustively dialyzed against distilled water , and a known quantity of norleucine was added to the dialyzed solution to monitor recovery . Aliquots of this solution were subjected to acid hydrolysis for 16 , 24 , * To whom reprint requests should be addressed . Biochemistry : Lee et al . 1 2 3 4 5 a FIG . 2 . NaDodSO4 / polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showing the isolation of AraC from cells harboring the tac promoter - araC fusion plasmid . Samples were taken from successive steps during the isolation , precipitated with CCl3COOH and analyzed on a NaDod - S04 / 12.5 % polyacrylamide gel . The isolation procedure was as described . Lanes : 1 , whole cells -LRB- 1 / 160,000 of the total preparation -RRB- ; 2 , crude cell extract -LRB- 1 / 80,000 of the total -RRB- ; 3 , after phosphocellulose chromatography -LRB- 1 / 7,000 of total -RRB- ; 4 , after acid precipitation -LRB- 1 / 7,000 of total -RRB- ; 5 , after fractionation on a Sephadex G - 100 column -LRB- 1 / 2,250 of total -RRB- ; 6 , after hydroxyapatite column chromatography -LRB- 1 / 1,720 of total -RRB- . The last three steps were necessary to remove numerous contaminants that made up about 20 % of the total in lane 3 . 48 , and 72 hr . The hydrolysates were analyzed with a Beckman 120C amino acid analyzer . The yields of alanine and glutamic acid plus amides , in conjunction with the known amino acid composition of AraC protein , were used to determine the quantity of AraC protein in the solution before dialysis . The calculated specific absorbance value of 1.88 is based on the assumption that there was no significant loss of AraC protein during dialysis . Assays of AraC protein activity in a DNA - dependent protein - synthesizing system showed that there was no detectable loss of total AraC protein activity after dialysis when the quantity of AraC protein was large -LRB- about 6 mg -RRB- . DNase I Cleavage - Protection Experiments . The procedure used was essentially as described except that reactions were scaled down so that each binding mixture contained 500 fmol of DNA at a concentration of 10 nM . DNA fragments were 5 ' - end labeled as described at a BstEII restriction site located at - 203 and then cleaved with Hae III at position 44 . -LSB- The numbering of nucleotides is based on the assignment of + 1 to the start point of araBAD transcription . -RSB- The 247 - base - pair -LRB- bp -RRB- fragment -LRB- from - 203 to 44 -RRB- was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

However , the RNA - seq data strongly suggest that the transcription start site is downstream of the annotated gene start for araT . 
The marbox was originally identified as a sequence whose sensitivity to DNase I was altered by the presence of MarA . 
While no relationship between oxidative stress and the structural modification of LPS has been reported , waaY was recently suggested as a member of the soxRS regulon in a genome - wide transcription analysis . 
DNA fragments carrying melR cloned in pCM117 - 303 , pVH - 173 or pJW15 were used as templates for mutagenesis . 
Like the example of AcrZ discussed here , small proteins associated with these transporters most likely have been overlooked due to experimental challenges in their detection . 
We also used pMYS135 carrying the SalI - Pstl fragment for detecting t , he g & R gene product . 
Dominant missense mutations in argP -LRB- argP d -RRB- that conferred canavanine resistance and rendered yggA - lac expression constitutive were obtained . 
Quantitation of CAP binding to the wild - type and mutant DNA regulatory regions by band shift analysis showed that the mutations have not altered the binding affinity of CAP . 
The footprint of ArgP on argO , as determined above with DNase I digestion , was more or less identical to that inferred from the exonuclease III digestion experiments -LRB- see Fig . 6A , B , below -RRB- . 
Minicells were then prepared and incubated with -LSB- 35 S -RSB- methionine -LRB- 0.2 M -LSB- 4.5 TBq / mmol -RSB- -RRB- for 1 h . 
For the batch culture experiments , the levels of nitrate remaining and the levels of nitrite accumulated in the vessel at the time of cell sampling for gene expression measurements are unknown , and it is unlikely that steady - state gene expression was achieved .

This hypermethylation is dependent on RhaR but independent of RhaS . 
Altogether , these data indicate that ArgP is able to activate transcription from the dapB promoter , provided that some sequences upstream of 81 are present , and is necessary for lysine to repress dapB expression . 
The two MelR binding sites required for this optimal repression are separated by 177 bp .

Autoradiograms were exposed for ~ 20 h . 
We therefore considered the possibility that the existence of bridging contacts formed between these two regions by E25 and R85 but absent in SoxS might account in part for the differences between MarA and SoxS with regard to the activation of different promoters . 
These derivatives were used to purify MelR173 carrying either a single cysteine residue at position 216 , adjacent to HTH 1 , or a single cysteine residue at position 269 , adjacent to HTH 2 .

Multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli can be mediated by induction of the SoxS or MarA protein , triggered by oxygen radicals -LRB- in the soxRS regulon -RRB- or certain antibiotics -LRB- in the marRAB regulon -RRB- , respectively . 
We note , however , that unlike a number of well - characterized CRP - dependent class II promoters , the fucPIK promoter does not have an extended 10 region -LRB- 3a -RRB- . 
We conclude that this is a genuine DNA site for AraC . 
The region of greatest amino acid sequence homology identified in XylS / AraC members is clearly a set of 99 residues found in most of the proteins at the C - terminal end of the regulators , although in some cases it is at the N - terminal end -LRB- CafR and Rob from E . coli -RRB- or in the central domain -LRB- Ada from E . coli and S . typhimurium and Ybbb from B . subtilis -RRB- .

All the genes mentioned above are functionally linked to the utilization of various hexuronates , glucuronates or galacturonates . 
Thus , yshA is also probably involved in the transport of a sugar , probably acidic . 
This , in turn , enhances the expression of a common set of promoters -LRB- the mar / soxRS regulons -RRB- , resulting in both multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance . 
As with nitrate - dependent repression , nitrite repression was lifted only when the strain carried lesions in both the narL and narP genes or in both the narX and narQ genes . 
Thus , NanR binds with high affinity to region 1 in a way analogous to its binding at nan .

Repression of the melR promoter on short - or long - cloned fragments . The figure shows the degree of MelR - dependent repression of the melR promoter carried on the long KK81 fragment or the short KK101 fragment . This repression was determined by measurement of b - galactosidase expression in WAM132 DmelR Dlac cells containing the melR promoter : : lac fusion carried by pRW70 with either the KK81 or the KK101 fragment insert . Repression is expressed as the ratio of the b - galactosidase level in cells carrying pJW15 , that encodes MelR , to the b - galactosidase level in cells carrying the control pAA121 plasmid , with no melR insert . This ratio was determined in media either with or without melibiose as indicated . The results are the average of six independent determinations .

The strong CAP binding site is immediately adjacent to the NagC box -LRB- E -RRB- and the weaker CAP site is included within the NagC box -LRB- E -RRB- . 
However , there is no evidence of the formation of a repression loop even in the presence of CAMP - CAP in this case . 
In addition , the PQ - or SoxSresponsive genes gatABD , gltA , nfnB , and ybjC were recently shown to be activated by constitutive expression of MarA . 
Results indicate that the downstream promoter -LRB- P1 -RRB- was responsible for Fnr - and NarP - regulated napF operon expression , whereas transcription from the upstream promoter -LRB- P2 -RRB- was activated only weakly by the Fnr protein and was inhibited by phospho - NarP and - NarL proteins . 
Two of these 10 were treB : : lacZ fusions ; the other eight were treC : : lacZ fusions . 
The CAP site can be identified on the DNA sequence nucleot , ides - 50 to - 30 shown in Fig . I -LRB- b -RRB- . 
How the interaction between benzoates and XylS leads to an active regulator is not yet understood , but regardless of the mechanism , the effector binding pocket and the DNA binding motif are not independent domains , as shown by intramolecular dominance of C - terminal mutations over N - terminal ones and by the reversal of this dominance in double mutants constructed in vitro . 
When both sites were wild type , transcription in the derepressed marR - deleted strain was 19 - fold that of the wild - type strain ; when only site I or site II was wild type , this ratio was reduced to 4.3 - and 2.6 - fold , respectively , showing that full repression requires both sites , but some repression can occur at one site independently of the other . 
We also present data suggesting that only one or the other of the loops can exist at one time , that arabinose shifts the amounts of the two looped forms present , and that looping may restrict access of AraC protein and RNA polymerase to binding sites within the looped region . 
In contrast , in all three known examples of MarA - repressed genes -LRB- hdeA , purA , and rob -RRB- , the marbox is in the backward orientation and is proximal to or overlapping the RNAP - binding site .

Repression factors are the mean values of at least three independent determinations . Probing cooperative repression The fact that 02 and 03 can compensate mutually for the abolition of each other suggests that both of them are able to cooperate with 01 . To examine this hypothesis , we measured repression of the XEwt constructs in the presence of equal amounts of subunits of tetrameric and dimeric Lac repressor . For this purpose we constructed two pACYC derived otherwise identical low copy plasmids carrying the respective lacI alleles under control of a very weak synthetic promoter . The amount of Lac repressor in cells harbouring these plasmids is higher than in the presence of a chromosomal i + gene , but lower than in the presence of an iq gene .

Identification of transcripfion start sites The 5 ' end of the narK transcript was determined by primer extension with RNA samples prepared from strain MV1190 -LRB- pMV45 -RRB- grown under different conditions -LCB- Fig . 2A -RRB- . With an oligonucleotide primer -LRB- NarKTS -RRB- which is complementary to a sequence extending from + 40 to + 68 of the narK open reading frame -LRB- ORF -RRB- , a major signal was obtained together with several weaker ones , both upstream and downstream , with the RNA from cells grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate -LRB- Fig . 2A , lane 6 -RRB- . The intensities of the major signal and of the weaker downstream signals were reduced both in aerobically grown cells -LRB- Fig . 2A , lane 1 -RRB- and in cells grown anaerobically without nitrate -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . Similar results were obtained with RNA from cells carrying piasmid pRS10 which contains an intact narKgene . These results suggested that the major transcript corresponded to narK mHHA and that the downstream transcripts were degradation products . The first nucleotide of the major narK transcript was an A located - 25 bases from the first ATG of the narK ORF and at the same position relative to the Fnr box as major transcription start site of the narGHJi promoter . Primer extension experiments performed with oligonucleotide NarKTS2 . which is complementary to a region -LRB- - 9 to - 58 bases from the narK ORF -RRB- upstream from the major transcription start site , confirmed the presence of the weaker upstream signals in cells containing plasmids pMV45 or pRSiO -LRB- Fig . 2B -RRB- . The most prominent of these signals was apparently initiated at a G located 111 bp upstream from the major transcription start site and was present in aerobic as well as anaerobically grown cells . Although the level of this transcript was increased slightly under anaerobic conditions -LRB- data not shown -RRB- , it appeared to be unaffected by the presence of nitrate -LRB- Fig . 2B -RRB- . Putative - 10 and - 35 sequences corresponding closely to the consensus sequences for o ™ - dependent transcription in E . co / / could be identified for this promoter . In an attempt to determine whether the putative upstream promoters were functional at a low copy number , the P2 promoter region , present on the Nsi \ ~ Sai \ fragment of piasmid pMV54 , and the region upstream from the Nsi \ of pMV54 were subcloned upstream from the IacZ gene in the operon fusion vector pGE593 -LRB- Eraso and Weinstock , 1992 -RRB- as described in the ' Experimentai Procedures . Beta - gatactosidase activities of RK66P -LRB- narK , pen -RRB- carrying the resulting plasmids were determined after aerobic or anaerobic growth with and without nitrate . No activity was found with the correctly oriented fragment carrying the region upstream from the Nsi \ site -LRB- piasmid pVB2 -RRB- but piasmid pVBI , which carried the correctly oriented P2 region , produced low but significant levels of p - galactosidase under all growth conditions . Insertion of the ii interposon -LRB- Prentki and Krisch , 1984 -RRB- just upstream from the P2 region fragment in pVBI -LRB- piasmid pVB3 -RRB- did not diminish the low level of expression observed , indicating that this activity was due to the promoter P2 and not to transcription which originated from vector sequences . These results suggested that narKgene transcription is initiated at two promoters . Pi and P2 . Promoter P1 produces the major transcript and appears to be positively regulated by anaerobiosis and nitrate , while promoter P2 appears to initiate a low , constitutive level of transcription . 3598 V . Bonnefoy and J . A . DeMoss pMV45 pMV51 pMV52 Sail 12 bp Fig . 3 . Construction of plasmids with altered narK regulatory regions . The Fnr and NarL boxes are represented as open boxes and identified as in Fig . 1 with the position of the centre of each box relative to the major transcription start site . PI , indicated by the numbers on the top line . The positions of the constructed restriction sites are indicated under these designations with the exception of the EcoRI site -LRB- E -RRB- which is located approximately 600 bp upstream from the PI transcription start site in the vector sequence . Open regions represent sequences which were deleted in the construction of ! he piasmid . induction observed was slightly reduced but the stimulation of expression by nitrate , under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions , was eliminated . These results demonstrate that the stimulation by nitrate of anaerobic expression of the narKgene is dependent on some sequence upstream from the Nsi \ site , presumably the NarL2 box . The putative NarLI box either is not functional in nitrate regulation or it functions only when the NarL2 box is present . To explore further the possible role of sequences upstream from the Fnrl box , a 12 bp linker sequence was inserted at the Sa / I site in the intact regulatory region of piasmid pMV54 and the expression the narK fusion on the resulting piasmid , pMV52 , was determined . The level of expression under anaerobic conditions was similar to that observed with the parental piasmid , pMV54 , indicating that displacement of the Fnr2 box by 12 bp relative to the Fnrl box had little effect on anaerobic induction from promoter PI . Furthermore , as previously shown for the narGHJI promoter -LRB- Li and DeMoss , 1988 -RRB- , nitrate stimulation of anaerobic expression was maintained when the upstream region containing a functional NarL box was displaced by approximately one helical turn . These results supported the suggestion that the Fnr1 and NarL2 boxes , which are homologous in sequence and location to functional c / s - acting factors in the narGHJI promoter , play similar roles in fhe regulation of expression of the narKgene . Deletion and insertion analysis of the regulatory region of narK To explore the possible roles of the putative Fnr and NarL boxes in the regulation of transcription from promoter PI , the effects of selective deletions and insertions within the regulatory region were determined . For this purpose Sal \ and Nsi \ sites were created by site - directed mutagenesis in the regulatory regions of plasmids pMV50 , pMV53 and pMV54 as diagrammed in Fig . 3 . The sequence changes involved in creating these sites had little or no effect on either anaerobic induction of expression or stimulation of expression by nitrate . Deletion of the sequences upstream from the Sa / I site -LRB- pMV51 in Fig . 3 -RRB- removed all of the putative promoter and regulatory regions except promoter PI and the Fnrl box . A reduced but significant level of anaerobic expression was observed with pMV51 and nitrate did not increase the level of expression . These results suggest that promoter PI and the Fnrl box are functional in the anaerobic induction of narK gene transcription but that maximum anaerobic expression is dependent on sequences located upstream from the Sa / I site . When the sequences located upstream from the Nsi \ were deleted -LRB- pMV55 in Fig . 3 -RRB- , the level of anaerobic Site - directed modification of the Fnr boxes To determine directly the role of the Fnrl and Fnr2 boxes in the anaerobic induction of expression of the narKgene , these sequences were modified by site - directed mutagenesis . Walker and DeMoss have recently shown that changing the left side of the Fnr box from TTGAT to TTGQT resulted in a drastic reduction of Fnr - dependent expression of the narGHJi opeion . Following introduction of this modification into the Fnrl box of pMV45 , the resulting plasmids were transformed into MV1190 and the cells plated on MacConkey - lactose medium supplemented with nitrate and ampicillin . Plasmids were isolated from both red and white colonies and the narK regulatory regions sequenced . As expected , the plasmids carried by fhe white colonies contained the modified Fnrl box while those from the red colonies were the unmodified wild type . The modified piasmid , pVB5 , expressed drastically reduced levels of p - galactosidase under all conditions , although some anaerobic induction and stimulation by nitrate under anaerobic conditions was observed . These results demonstrated that anaerobic induction of narK gene transcription is dependent on a functional Fnrl box . When the Fnr2 box of pMV45 was similarly modified . Regulation of narK gene expression in Escherichia coli 3599 cells of MV1190 carrying the mutant piasmid were isolated as ' fish - eye ' colonies on fhe nitrate - supplemented , MacConkey - lactose plates . In this case , the modified piasmid , pVB6 , expressed essentially the same levels of p - galactosidase in strain RK66P as fhe wild - type piasmid , pMV45 , under anaerobic conditions but the stimulation by nitrate was reduced about three - fold . When both Fnr boxes were modified , the resulting piasmid , pVB7 , expressed levels of | 3 - galactosidase very similar to those observed with p \ / B5 where only the Fnrl box was modified . Assuming that the Fnr2 box would be affected similarly to the Fnrl box by the modification , these results establish that a functional Fnr2 box is not required for the anaerobic induction of transcription of narK but it does appear to be required for the maximum stimulation of transcription of the gene by nitrate . Discussion The major narK transcript , identified in the primer extension experiments , accumulated at very low levels under aerobic conditions and was induced to maximum levels under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate . This is in agreement with the demonstration by Stewart and Parales that narKgene expression is dependent on the / rans - acting factors Fnr and NarL , which are activated by anaerobiosis and nitrate , respectively . The start site for the major transcript coincides exactly with the one predicted by alignment of the Fnrl box identified in fhe narK promoter region with the Fnr box and transcription start site identified in the narGHJI promoter sequence . Putative - 10 and - 35 sequences can be identified for fhe narK transcription start site which would constitute a relatively poor o ™ - dependent promoter . The putative - 10 region . lAAGGT -LRB- compared to the consensus TATAAT -RRB- . and the putative - 35 region , TTGCCT -LRB- compared to the consensus TTGACA -RRB- . are separated by 14 nucleotides , compared to the optimum 17 - nucleotlde separation for the consensus promoter sequence -LRB- Aoyoma etai , 1983 -RRB- . When the narK regulatory region was analysed with the MACTARGSEARCH Program -LRB- Mulligan et ai , 1984 -RRB- and the consensus sequence for E . coli promoter PI received a score of 40.2 % . According to Mulligan et ai , most of the promoters which have a poor homology score -LRB- < 45 % -RRB- are known to require activator -LRB- s -RRB- for maximal expression . As in the case of the narGHJt promoter , a consensus Fnr box -LRB- Fnrl -RRB- centred at - 41.5 bp from the transcription start site is critical for synthesis of the major narK transcript , which occurs primarily under anaerobic conditions when Fnr is activated and presumably bound to fhe Fnr box . The promoter for one of the minor transcnpts identified in the primer extension experiments , P2 , appears to be more similar to the o ™ - dependent promofer consensus .

P2 appeared to function as a constitutive , low - level promoter when subcioned into a lac operon fusion vector . A narK , pcnB strain carrying a piasmid -LRB- pVBI -RRB- with only the P2 promoter fused to / acZexpressed low but significant levels of p - galactosidase activity under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions and did not appear to be regulated by nitrate . These results are in agreement with the low level of this transcript found with the complete narK promoter but are in apparent contradiction with the observation In the primer extension experiments that the P2 promoter transcript synthesis seemed to be increased In absence of oxygen . The second putative Fnr box , centred 38 bp further upstream from the Fnr1 box in the narK regulatory region , has no apparent homologue in the narGHJI promoter . Based on the effects of site - directed modification of the Fnr2 sequence , it does not appear to play a direct role in the Fnr - dependent , anaerobic induction of narK expression . On the other hand , deletion of the regulatory region upstream from the Fnrl box , which included the Fnr2 box , significantly reduced the level of anaerobic expression , suggesting that sequences upstream from the Fnr1 box may have some influence on the level of anaerobic expression induced by Fnr . If this is a positive effect of specific upstream sequences , the effect is maintained when the upstream region is displaced one helical turn further upstream from the Fnrl box by the insertion of 12 bp at the Sa / I site in piasmid pMV52 . It is possible , however , that the reduced level of anaerobic expression resulting from the deletion of the upstream sequences in piasmid pMV51 Is due to interference by the sequence which replaced the deleted region rather than to the loss of specific sequences . In either case , fhere is no evidence that the Fnr2 box affects the Fnr - dependent , anaerobic induction of narK expression . Rather , its modification in piasmid pVB5 appeared to influence only the level of nitrate stimulation of transcription . Based on a comparison of the 5 ' untranslated regions3600 y . Bonnefoy and J . A . DeMoss of the narK gene and the narGHJI operon , Noji et al . proposed that a homologous sequence , TACTC - CTTA , shared by the two upstream regions -LCB- Fig . 1 -RRB- defined a NarL - binding site . This sequence was present in a 29 bp fragment which had been shown by Li and DeMoss to contain a c / s - acting factor required for NarL - mediated nitrate stimulation of narGHJI transcription and Dong etai have recently shown by saturation mutagenesis of this region that specificity for the narGHJI operon response resides in the six - base sequence TACTCC . While there is very little homology between the narK and narGHJI regulatory regions other than this sequence and the Fnrl box sequence , a closely related sequence , TACTCacTA -LRB- NarLI in Fig . 1 -RRB- , is located in the intervening region of the narKgene . The elimination of the nitrate response by the deletion of the NarL2 box from the regulatory region of narK -LRB- piasmid pMV51 -RRB- demonstrates that the NarL2 box is required for NarL - mediated stimulation and that the NarLI box alone can not promote the stimulation of transcription by nitrate . However , the results do not rule out the possibility that the NarLI box is functional but only in the presence of the NarL2 box where it might act as a secondary and perhaps co - operative NarL - binding site . The centres of the two NarL boxes , spaced 96 bp -LRB- or approximately nine integral helical turns -RRB- apart , would present binding sites on the same face of the DNA and could permit interaction between the bound NarL subunits . While it is dear , as discussed above , that the assumed inactivation of the Fnr2 box by site - directed modification did not affect the anaerobic induction of narK transcription , it did significantly reduce the level of stimulation by nitrate under anaerobic conditions . It is possible that Fnr binding to the Fnr2 box augments the binding to the Fnr1 box and permits the higher level of anaerobic expression which occurs in the presence of nitrate . The two sequences are centred at positions separated by 38 bp -LRB- or 3.6 turns of DNA -RRB- which place the bound Fnr on opposite faces of the DNA and make a direct interaction difficult to envisage . An alternative possibility is that Fnr , by analogy with CAP -LRB- cAMP activator protein -RRB- with which it shares considerable sequence homology -LRB- Shaw et ai , 1983 -RRB- , acts as a DNA bending profein when bound to the Fnr2 box and facilitates loop formation which may be involved in NarL - mediated stimulation of transcripfion . In this report , we establish fhat the narKgene and the narGHJI operon share the same regulation pattern : induction by anaerobiosis and stimulation by nitrate . But at the molecular level , it appears that the regulation and expression of narK gene is more complex than for the narGHJ / operon in fhat narKgene has more than one promoter , two potential Fnr - binding sites which have distinguishable regulatory effects , and at least one functional NarL - binding site . The narK and narGHJI promoter regions share homologous Fnr and NarL box sequences separated by approximately 150 bp of non - homologous sequences which in both cases include specific regions required for full , functional interaction of the two / rans - acting factors with the transcriptional complex . The construction and study of hybrid promoters should provide significant insight into the regulation of these genes at the molecular level and understanding of the mechanisms underlying the activation of transcription initiation by NarL and Fnr at the narK and narGHJi promoters .

We had hoped that their location would identify the region involved in the recognition of base sequence around positions - 104 and - 59 at pmelAB . Clearly , the KN218 substitution might signal a role for helix - turn - helix 1 , but the disparate nature of the other substitutions was unexpected . We considered that some of the mutations might be causing a subtle change in MelR that shifts its conformation towards the active form . Since the activity of MelR in vivo can be triggered by melibiose , we measured the concentration - dependence of melibiose activation for the different MelR mutants . To do this , M182 cells carrying the KK43 pmelAB fragment cloned in pRW50 , and pJW15 carrying the different meiR derivatives , were grown in media containing different concentrations of melibiose . The melibiose concentrations required for 50 % induction were measured and are listed in .

-LRB- vi -RRB- For lysC , there was a 5 - fold repression by Lys in the argP strain -LRB- that is , ArgP independent -RRB- ; this presumably represents the regulation imposed by the Lys - responsive riboswitch that is proposed to exist in the leader region of the lysC mRNA -LRB- 39 , 44 -RRB- . 
The 652 - bp DNA fragment for the mobility shift assays shown in Fig . 1 covers the complete intergenic region shown in the figure and extends to the sequence at the 5 = and the 3 = ends shown here . 
Thus , the aral region consists of two physically separable and functionally distinct sites . 
The magnitudes of Rob ' s effects are modest , however , and the protein may thus play a role as a general transcription cofactor . 
Repression is dependent upon the co - operative binding of NagC to these two sites resulting in DNA loop formation , which can be detected in vitro by DNaseI footprinting . 
Thus , it appears that GntT is important for growth on low gluconate concentrations , for entry into logarithmic phase , and for cometabolism of gluconate and glucose . 
As expected , addition of cAMP to the cya mutant , but not to the crp mutant , relieved the catabolite repression to a level equivalent to that of the wild type .

From the JC7623 derivative -LRB- strain IMW40 -RRB- wifh fhe described phenotype , the disrupted IrbA was transferred by Pi transducfion to strain MC4100 to test growth and expression of nuo - iacZ fusions . Strains IMW40 and IMW41 were tested for presence of iriiAr . spc ' and lack of an intact irhA by Southern blotting -LRB- nof shown -RRB- . Genomic DNA of the derivative and of fhe parental strain digested with EcoRI was probed with the EcoRV - C / al fragment adjacent to htiA . The hybridization pattern matched thaf expected for the parental strain -LRB- 4.6 kb fragment -RRB- and the IrhAwspc ' mutant -LRB- 6.6 kb fragment -RRB- . Southern hybridization of wild - type chromosomal DNA with a IrhA probe -LRB- Sft / i - EcoRV fragment of Fig . 1 -RRB- showed oniy one hybridizing band , demonstrating that only one IrhA copy is present in the E . co / / genome -LRB- not shown -RRB- . Effects of -LRB- rhA . . spc ' mutation on growtb and niio - iacZ expression Strain IMW41 witft the chromosomaily inactivated IrhA was analysed for growth wifh fermenfabie and non - fermentable substrates . With succinate and acetate as the carbon source , growth depends on respiration , mainly via NADH oxidation . Growth rate and growth yields of fhe mutanf were not . or only slightly , reduced compared with fhe wild type , both during aerobic growth with glucose or wifh nonfermenfable substrates -LRB- succinate , aoefate -RRB- . Anaerobic growth by fumarafe or nifrate respirafion was also unaffected . Accordingly , the expression of nuogggAB ' - ' / acZ and of / luo ^ . / ^ - ' ^ S ' - ' / acZ was similar in both parental and mutant strains under respective conditions . Mufants in nuo are known to be affected in growth on acetate and amino acids -LRB- FruB et ai , 1994 -RRB- . Neither growth on these substrates nor expression of nuo was changed significantly in fhe IrbA mufants . Since only one copy of IriiA was present , it has to be concluded that IrhA and LrhA are not essential under fhe conditions tested and do not significantly affect nuo expression and respiratory -LRB- i . e . NADH oxidation - dependent -RRB- growth . Discussion Transcriptionai reguiation of the nuo genes : regufatory regjons , -LRB- ranscr / pf / ona / reguiators and effectors The expression of nuoAB -LRB- C -RRB- responds to the presence of eiectron acceptors , C4 dicarboxylates and to various transcriptional regulators . The maximal differences were obtained for growth by nitrafe respiration -LRB- H - as donor -RRB- and growth by fermenfafion . These were a 4.7 - fold repression for nuog ^ gAB ' - ' lacZ -LRB- complefe intergenic region upstream of nuo -RRB- and a 13.4 - fold repression for m / o ^ 77 / lB ' - / acZ -LRB- truncated intergenic region -RRB- under fermentative conditions . The reguiatory responses weve lower fhan those observed for other respiratory genes , e . g . nifrate or nitrite reductases -LRB- Showe and DeMoss , 1963 ; Jayaraman et ai , 1987 -RRB- . but for an essential enzyme -LRB- ike NADH : quinone oxidoreducfase , greafer responses are not expected . Comparison of the protein and operon fusions shows that the expression of nuo is regulated only al the transcriptiona ! and not at the franslatjonal level . Growth on substrates supplying high amounts of NADH , e . g . glucose or giycei ' ol , did nof stimulate nuo expression compared wifh growth with H : . or formate . The rationale could be achievement of maximal proton translocation and energy conservation under NADH - iimiting conditions . i . e . growth with H2 or formate . It is possible , too . that factors other than NADH contribute to supply the respective regulatory signal . This couid be eiflier fhe growth rate or C 1995 Blackwell Science Lid . Molecular Microbiology , Transcriptional regulation of Escherichia coii nuo genes 529 the infracellular NAD -LRB- P -RRB- H / NAD -LRB- P -RRB- ratio . How this ratio changes upon growth with different hydrogen donors is not known . Two distinct regulatory regions have been identified by dissection at base pair - 277 . The regions might correspond to the two franscripfional start sites detected here and future work has to show which transcriptional factors and signals can be related to each promoter . It is conceivable that the regulatory sifes controlling expression of fhe disfal promoter upstream of - 172 / 173 are not present on the short fusions nuo277 . This assumption could explain lhe different expression of nuo from the long -LRB- nuoe ^ e -RRB- and the short -LCB- nuo277 -RRB- fusions . The DNA region up to base pair - 277 is required for regulation by Oo and nitrate and fhe franscriptional reguiators ArcA . NarL . FNR and IHF . The main effecf was an anaerobic repression by ArcA and a nitrate stimulation by NarL . FNR repressed slightly , and possibly indirectly , during anaerobic growth . Centred around - 113bp , a sequence -LRB- AATGGTGTTGA - TATT -RRB- wilh some simiiarity to the IHF - consensus YAACTTNTTGATTTW -LRB- Y , CU ; W , MJ -RRB- is found -LRB- Goodrich et ai , 1990 -RRB- . This site shares fhe TTGAT sequence with the potential FNR consensus around base pair - 107 . Therefore , via the shared sequences , competition between IHF and FNR might occur , as demonstrated by fhe enhanced nuo expression in the bimO fnr double mutant . iHF and FNH may function as repressors competing for overlapping sites , or either of the factors may enhance ArcA - dependent repression . Other promoters responding fo ArcA and NarL in combination have not been described so far , whereas various promoters regulated by FNR and NarL -LRB- Jones and Gunsalus , 1987 ; Sfewarf . 1982 ; Li and Stewart , 1992 -RRB- or ArcA and FNR are known -LRB- Sawers and Suppmann , 1992 ; Hassan and Sun , 1992 : Cotter and Gunsalus , 1992 -RRB- . In future studies , the sites essential for ArcA and NarL action should be identified by deletion analysis to yield more information on ArcA and NarL interaction . The region upstream of - 277 was required for a new regulatory effect : the transcriptional stimulation by C ^ dicarboxylates and some other factors both under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions . The corresponding regulators and regulatory sites are nof known so far . LrhA , a presumed regulafor of the LysR family , is not essential for the transoripfional regulation of nuo . Since most of the regulators of the LysR family are located adjacent to the target genes , the region of XY -RSB- e E . coii genome beyond the \ S1 element could contain unknown target genes of LrhA -LRB- Rudd , 1992 -RRB- .

NanC regulation seems to be quite complex . 
Although there are many moderate to weak matches to the consensus CRP - binding site sequence in the rhaSR - rhaBAD intergenic region , three of these , sites 2 through 4 , seemed most likely to directly influence rhaSR activation . 
In practice , considerable similarity between the regulatory protein and the regulated protein is only seen in the regulatory protein RbsR and a periplasmic component RbsB of HAT , which is encoded by the operon rbsDABCK under the repression by RbsR .

NarL , FNR and Fis can bind to pnir together , but NarL interferes with the binding of IHF To investigate the mechanism by which NarL counteracts IHF - and Fis - mediated repression at pnir , we used gel retardation assays and DNase I footprinting to examine the binding of NarL , FNR , Fis and IHF . 
Such promoters , known as class II promoters , are distinct from class I promoters , where FNR binds further upstream and interacts only with the RNAP subunits . 
As IHF binds at target sites via the DNA minor groove and requires a narrow minor groove -LRB- Rice et al . , 1996 -RRB- , it is easy to understand why the binding of NarL at pnir prevents IHF -- DNA interactions at the IHF I site .

On the other hand , if the side group of a given wild - type amino acid residue does not make a specific protein -- DNA contact with a functional group of a wild - type base pair , then the effect on transcription activation of combining a single alanine substitution of that amino acid of Rob and a single base - pair substitution at that position of the robbox would be significantly different from that conferred by the more severe of the two individual mutations ; that is , the effect on activation conferred by one mutation would not be masked by the effect conferred by the other , and thus , the mutations would be non - epistatic to one another .

While LPS has an extremely complicated and diverse structure , even in the same species -LRB- e . g . , E . coli -RRB- , genetic evidence suggests that the barrier property is attributed mainly to lipid A and the core oligosaccharides , since mutations in O - antigen synthesis do not markedly affect membrane integrity or permeability -LRB- 13 , 29 -RRB- . 
The other putative FNR protein binding site , centered at - 97.5 , was not involved in anaerobic induction . 
Sequence analysis of the 5 promoter regions of these genes identified plausible matches to met - box sequences for three of these , and subsequent electrophoretic mobility - shift assay analysis showed that for two such loci their repressor affinity is higher than or comparable with the known metB operator , suggesting that they are directly regulated . 
Accordingly , the SD sequence would be spaced either 5 or 8 nucleotides , respectively , from the GUG initiation codon .

In enterobacteria , the regulon also includes two nitrite - responsive loci , nipAB -LRB- hcp - hcr -RRB- and nipC -LRB- dnrN -RRB- , thus confirming the identity of the effector , i . e . nitrite . 
MarA and its two homologues SoxS and Rob regulate a common set of genes in the E . coli chromosome -LRB- Jair et al . , 1996a ; Martin et al . , 1999 ; 2000 -RRB- . 
The reduction by GntR , however , was not complete probably because the plasmid copy number of pGNTR2 , a pACYC177 derivative , is lower than that of pGNTK - CAT1 or pGNTKU - CAT7 , a pBR322 derivative . 
Effect of nitrate -LRB- A -RRB- and nitrite -LRB- B -RRB- concentration on nrfA - lacZ expression in narL and narP strains . 
Therefore it is likely that MarR is simply a local repressor of the marRAB operon . 
When both proteins were present -LRB- Fig . 6A , lanes 8 -- 10 -RRB- , a unique NarL -- FNR -- DNA complex was produced , indicating that both activators could bind simultaneously to pnir . 
The circles represent transposon insertions , either a Lac transcriptional fusion -LRB- open -RRB- or not -LRB- filled -RRB- .

Transcription of # rd in aerobic conditions In aerobically grown E . coli the # rd / # rd - red mRNA abundance was low -LRB- V60 times less -RRB- when compared with that of the hmp gene -LRB- , Fig . 1A -RRB- , suggesting a minor contribution of FlRd to NO protection under aerobic conditions . 
One explanation for this may be that CRP is only able to bind to the melAB promoter in the presence of MelR bound both upstream and downstream . 
However , mutations in the rhaS gene showed only a twofold effect on transcription from ps , , p1 and p3 . 
Thus , possible effects of DNA bending on binding site selection by the Rob are obscured by the sequence of the binding site used in this study . 
The current studies support our previous suggestion that transcription activation at pmelAB requires the binding of MelR to site 2 , which overlaps the -- 35 sequence of the promoter . 
In vitro transcription assays These were performed using the system described by Kolb et al . , as described by Savery et al . . 
Nitrate and nitrite control is mediated by homologous DNAbinding response regulators -LRB- NarL and NarP -RRB- , which communicate with homologous sensor proteins -LRB- NarX and NarQ -RRB- -LRB- reviewed in references 8 and 26 -RRB- . 
It is interesting to speculate that the NrfA nitrite reductase may therefore have a higher -LRB- e . g . , stronger -RRB- affinity for nitrite than does the nirB encoded nitrite reductase .

To determine if the lack of binding was due to an uncharacterized rbsR strain or to low RbsR expression , extracts were prepared from the strain MRil21 -LRB- demonstrated to be rbsR + -LSB- Lopilato et al . , 19841 -RRB- grown in sugars to control the induction by ribose or to control the catabolite repression . No binding was seen using any of the extracts ; thus , binding could not be observed using genomically encoded rbsR . The in vitro shift assays presented here using rbsR + extract and D - ribose supported previous observations of the control by D - ribose upon ribose transport -LRB- Lopilato et al . , 1984 -RRB- . Purified RbsR was shown to bind to the operator fragment -LRB- data not shown -RRB- , providing evidence for the direct interaction of the repressor molecule with bind - ing at the proposed operator site and indicating that DNA - binding activity of RbsR did not require a secondary protein . Control of expression of RbsR is not well understood . The rbsR gene was previously proposed to form a separate transcriptional unit from the rest of the rbs operon -LRB- Lopilato et al . , 1984 -RRB- . Analysis of the rbsK coding sequence revealed no obvious promoter sequence for rbsR . Nuclease S1 mapping of the 3 ' end of the rbs operon -LRB- Hope , 1986 -RRB- revealed two transcriptional termination positions at hairpins 1 and 2 located in rbsR . A longer transcript was detectable , however , suggesting rbsR expression from the same transcript as rbsK with down - regulation at the hairpins . The proximity of rbsR to rbsK and the placement of838 C . A . Mauzy and M . A . Hermodson the ribosome binding site within the rbsK gene also suggests that the rbsR gene is located on the same transcript as rbsK . Because RbsR did not bind to the region of DNA spanning the 3 ' end of rbsK and the first 260 bp of rbsR or to a potential secondary promoter region between rbsB and rbsK , regulated expression of rbsR from those regions appears unlikely , although constitutive expression from a secondary promoter upstream of rbsR has not been excluded . Another interesting feature of RbsR expression is the presence of a TTG start codon in the coding sequence , which was verified using the protein sequence from an RbsR - @ - galactosidase fusion protein and from affinity - purified RbsR . Of all known start codons in the Genebank sequences , the TTG has a frequency of less than 2 % . The unusual start codon for rbsR also suggests down - regulation of RbsR expression due to lower translational efficiency , as evidence indicates that there is a strong preference for the ATG start codon in the bacterial translational machinery -LRB- Munson et al . , 1984 ; Schulz & Reznikoff , 1990 -RRB- . Although a small amount of RbsR was purified by affinity chromatography late in this study , we have had some difficulty producing significant amounts of the protein . The several sites at which down - regulation of expression may occur may be partly responsible for the low expression from the various plasmids . Toxicity of high levels of the repressor may also be a problem . Because we only had crude extracts available during most of this investigation , the DNA - binding studies were performed with them . The results , together with the control experiments run simultaneously , indicate that RbsR does bind rbs0 , and of the sugars tested , only ribose was effective in disrupting that complex . No ancillary factors were needed to form the RbsR - rbsO complex when pure RbsR was tested . At least under the conditions used , no other potential RbsR binding sites in the rbs operon were found , although the use of crude extracts may have interfered with weak binding at other sites . We believe that to be less than likely on physiological grounds . If ribokinase is noncoordinately expressed relative to the rbs transport genes as early data suggest -LRB- David & Weismeyer , 1970 -RRB- , then a constitutive promoter within the operon is the most likely explanation . We have attempted to find evidence for transcription from such a promoter without success -LRB- Hope , 1986 -RRB- . Analysis employing crude extracts prevents the determination of binding constants for the RbsR - rbsO complex and for the RbsR - sugar interaction . However , the footprinting assays should not be affected , since enormous excesses of competitor DNA are used in such assays . By homology to LacI -LRB- Mauzy & Hermodson , 1992 -RRB- the first 60 residues of RbsR form the DNA - binding domain . The highest degree of similarity between the members of this family of repressors is found in this domain , and the most similar region of all spans the first 22 residues of RbsR . These residues form the first helix - turn - helix and contact the DNA -LRB- Kaptein et al . , 1985 ; Gordon et al . , 1988 ; Rolfes & Zalkin , 1988 -RRB- . The degree of similarity is so striking in both the protein sequences -LRB- Fig . 1 ; Mauzy & Hermodson , 1992 -RRB- and the operator sequences that the question of how specificity is attained must be considered . Mutagenesis studies and analysis of amino acid sequence conservation within this family of proteins consistently indicate that the hydrophobic core residues that hold the bundle of helices together are very intoler - ant to change -LRB- Gordon et al . , 1988 ; Rolfes & Zalkin , 1988 -RRB- . The hydrophobic core residues in RbsR would be '' 4 , V - 7 , A - 8 , V - 17 , V - , A - , L - 42 , and Y - 44 by homology to LacI -LRB- Fig . 1 ; Kaptein et al . , 1985 ; Gordon et al . , 1988 ; Mauzy & Hermodson , 1992 -RRB- . These positions are either invariant between members of this protein family or show only conservative changes . This no doubt reflects the crucial roles these residues play in stabilizing the domain structure . Because the side chains of these residues project into the center of the domain , they would not be involved in DNA contacts . It has been suggested that other conserved residues in the helix - l - turn - helix - 2 region could function as contacts to the conserved bases in the operators -LRB- Rolfes & Zalkin , 1988 -RRB- . These would include T - 3 , D - 6 , A - 1 1 , S - 13 , T - 16 , and S - 18 . That leaves few positions available to confer specificity , especially in helix - 2 , which presumably makes the principal DNA contacts -LRB- Kaptein et al . , 1985 ; Gordon et al . , 1988 -RRB- . T - 14 , S - 15 , H - 19 , and N - 22 are the amino acids in RbsR at those positions , and an identical amino acid is found at each of those positions in at least one of the other repressors -LRB- RbsR and PurR differ only at position 15 in this region where the former has Ser and the latter Thr , yet the operator sequences for rbs and pur are about as different as any in this series -LSB- Fig . 61 -RRB- . Thus , the explanation of the functional significance of these relationships must await more detailed structural analyses . The proposed turn region between helix - 1 and helix3 in RbsR is truncated by one residue as compared to the other members of this repressor family -LRB- Fig . 1 ; Mauzy & Hermodson , 1992 -RRB- . Initial studies by Pabo and Sauer suggested that a glycine was critical at this position . However , later mutational studies -LRB- Gordon et al . , 1988 -RRB- and additional protein sequences of other members of this repressor family imply that there is much less se - quence constraint at this position . Indeed , in the case of RbsR , the absence of one residue in this position indicates that this region does not require a three - residue turn . The residue following this deletion in RbsR is a Leu where it is Val in the other members of the protein family . The absence of a branch at the @ - carbon of the Leu may confer the required additional flexibility to allow a shorter turn in RbsR , although the very short two - residue turn is bound to affect the conformations of the amino acids leading into the helices at that site .

This seems a reasonable supposition ; neither of the 10 elements has an upstream TG -LRB- extended 10 -RRB- motif , and therefore the changes designed to inactivate the promoter P2 10 element are predicted not to influence the promoter P1 10 element . 
Overlapping regulation by the Nar regulatory systems and the NsrR repressor likely controls transcription of at least five operons : hcp - hcr , nrfABCDEFG , yeaR - yoaG , ytfE and , in Shewanella spp . , nnrS . 
As described more fully in the accompanying paper -LRB- Saviola et al . , 1998 -RRB- , we now favor a mechanism for AraC action in which the N - terminal arm of AraC binds to the DNA binding domain of the protein in the absence of arabinose , and is pulled away from the domain in the presence of arabinose , thereby providing more freedom to the DNA binding domains .
